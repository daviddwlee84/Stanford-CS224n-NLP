Norman adventurers founded the Kingdom of Sicily under Roger II after conquering southern Italy on the Saracens and Byzantines, and an expedition on behalf of their duke, William the Conqueror, led to the Norman conquest of England at the Battle of Hastings in 1066.

The treaty offered Rollo and his men the French lands between the river Epte and the Atlantic coast in exchange for their protection against further Viking incursions. The area corresponded to the northern part of present-day Upper Normandy down to the river Seine, but the Duchy would eventually extend west beyond the Seine.

Having obtained the consent of pope Gregory VII and acting as his vassal, Robert continued his campaign conquering the Balkan peninsula as a foothold for western feudal lords and the Catholic Church. After allying himself with Croatia and the Catholic cities of Dalmatia, in 1081 he led an army of 30,000 men in 300 ships landing on the southern shores of Albania, capturing Valona, Kanina, Jericho (Orikumi), and reaching Butrint after numerous pillages. They joined the fleet that had previously conquered Corfu and attacked Dyrrachium from land and sea, devastating everything along the way. Under these harsh circumstances, the locals accepted the call of emperor Alexius I Comnenus to join forces with the Byzantines against the Normans. The Albanian forces could not take part in the ensuing battle because it had started before their arrival. Immediately before the battle, the Venetian fleet had secured a victory in the coast surrounding the city. Forced to retreat, Alexius ceded the command to a high Albanian official named Comiscortes in the service of Byzantium. The city's garrison resisted until February 1082, when Dyrrachium was betrayed to the Normans by the Venetian and Amalfitan merchants who had settled there.

In complexity theory, problems that lack polynomial-time solutions are considered to be intractable for more than the smallest inputs. In fact, the Cobham\u2013Edmonds thesis states that only those problems that can be solved in polynomial time can be feasibly computed on some computational device. Problems that are known to be intractable in this sense include those that are EXPTIME-hard. If NP is not the same as P, then the NP-complete problems are also intractable in this sense. To see why exponential-time algorithms might be unusable in practice, consider a program that makes 2n operations before halting. For small n, say 100, and assuming for the sake of example that the computer does 1012 operations each second, the program would run for about 4 \u00d7 1010 years, which is the same order of magnitude as the age of the universe.

Geneva was John Calvin's adopted home and the centre of the Calvinist movement. In Geneva, Hugues, though Catholic, was a leader of the \"Confederate Party\", so called because it favoured independence from the Duke of Savoy through an alliance between the city-state of Geneva and the Swiss Confederation. The label Huguenot was purportedly first applied in France to those conspirators (all of them aristocratic members of the Reformed Church) involved in the Amboise plot of 1560: a foiled attempt to wrest power in France from the influential House of Guise. The move would have had the side effect of fostering relations with the Swiss. Thus, Hugues plus Eidgenosse by way of Huisgenoten supposedly became Huguenot, a nickname associating the Protestant cause with politics unpopular in France.[citation needed]"},{"qas":[{"question":"What helped spread Protestantism in France?","id":"92ff2a22df7732eccbe32fea2","answers":[{"text":"availability of the Bible in vernacular languages","answer_start":4},{"text":"the Bible in vernacular languages","answer_start":20},{"text":"The availability of the Bible in vernacular languages","answer_start":0}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"When did the first French language bible appear?","id":"e849b1cd9f4a5cfe7df88aada","answers":[{"text":"Around 1294","answer_start":275},{"text":"1294","answer_start":282},{"text":"Around 1294","answer_start":275}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who translated this version of the scriptures?","id":"ffbab55f808c731ee54a71e3d","answers":[{"text":"Guyard de Moulin","answer_start":366},{"text":"Guyard de Moulin","answer_start":366},{"text":"Guyard de Moulin","answer_start":366}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"An illustrated, paraphrased version of this appeared when?","id":"eda66edcd0efca7df36c7cf27","answers":[{"text":"1487","answer_start":500},{"text":"1487","answer_start":500},{"text":"1487","answer_start":500}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Jean De Rely's illustrated French-language scriptures were first published in what city?","id":"9bb4def42edef3c4a0bfe382a","answers":[{"text":"Paris","answer_start":491},{"text":"Paris","answer_start":491},{"text":"Paris","answer_start":491}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"1294","answer_start":282}],"question":"In what year did the Protestant Reformation arrive in France?","id":"d644c7b377eee24a1bf708efd","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"France","answer_start":151}],"question":"In what country did the Protestant Reformation get its start?","id":"bf7cff76bdcfbdbfeab0d67d6","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"1294","answer_start":282}],"question":"In what year did the Reformed church of France get established?","id":"b4f91a7bfcd9ffa18ee9ef3eb","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"France","answer_start":151}],"question":"Where was the Roman Catholic Priest Guyard de Moulin from?","id":"da9fb1aece42457863d8d536e","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"1487","answer_start":500}],"question":"Where was Jean de Rely from?","id":"2fc83a2c74c88f12eeb4ee1f4","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"The availability of the Bible in vernacular languages was important to the spread of the Protestant movement and development of the Reformed church in France.

Janet Gray and other supporters of the hypothesis suggest that the name huguenote would be roughly equivalent to little Hugos, or those who want Hugo."},{"qas":[{"question":"Who was one French pro-reform Roman Catholic of the 15th century?

The Gallicans briefly achieved independence for the French church, on the principle that the religion of France could not be controlled by the Bishop of Rome, a foreign power. During the Protestant Reformation, Lefevre, a professor at the University of Paris, published his French translation of the New Testament in 1523, followed by the whole Bible in the French language in 1530. William Farel was a student of Lefevre who went on to become a leader of the Swiss Reformation, establishing a Protestant government in Geneva. Jean Cauvin (John Calvin), another student at the University of Paris, also converted to Protestantism. Long after the sect was suppressed by Francis I, the remaining French Waldensians, then mostly in the Luberon region, sought to join William Farel, Calvin and the Reformation, and Olivetan published a French Bible for them. The French Confession of 1559 shows a decidedly Calvinistic influence. Sometime between 1550 and 1580, members of the Reformed church in France came to be commonly known as Huguenots.[citation needed]"},{"qas":[{"question":"When was the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre?","id":"0408a0d36d7d2f97afaa3d964","answers":[{"text":"24 August \u2013 3 October 1572","answer_start":62},{"text":"24 August \u2013 3 October 1572","answer_start":62},{"text":"24 August \u2013 3 October 1572","answer_start":62}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What group killed thousands of Huguenots?","id":"fafd1acfcec2af17f988c8a4c","answers":[{"text":"Catholics","answer_start":90},{"text":"Catholics","answer_start":90},{"text":"Catholics","answer_start":90}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How many Huguenots were killed in Toulouse?","id":"8e58ca309f642a1755cccccd6","answers":[{"text":"Nearly 3,000","answer_start":352},{"text":"Nearly 3,000","answer_start":352},{"text":"Nearly 3,000","answer_start":352}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"When was amnesty granted to those responsible for the massacre?","id":"ca1ea1209b2ae9f99cefd4e5c","answers":[{"text":"1573","answer_start":773},{"text":"1573","answer_start":773},{"text":"1573","answer_start":773}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Reports document that how many Parisien Protestants were killed by September 17?","id":"adc91e20e17a243ccbf7ffe5c","answers":[{"text":"almost 25,000","answer_start":636},{"text":"almost 25,000","answer_start":636},{"text":"almost 25,000","answer_start":636}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"2,000","answer_start":512}],"question":"How many Huguenots were killed in Bordeaux?","id":"ef13ef4bc604d1315f7b1dd6e","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Lyons","answer_start":300}],"question":"In which French city was about 2,000 Huguenots killed?","id":"c03dbae010fb0b0de8e2bcbec","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"25,000","answer_start":643}],"question":"How many Huguenots were killed altogether in France?","id":"cc5fc11c730ed4bf1f689d4fa","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"3,000","answer_start":359}],"question":"How many Huguenots were slaughtered in Orleans?","id":"b8f2f7dd2ccd32eb25e9d556b","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"3,000","answer_start":573}],"question":"How many Huguenots were slain in Toulouse?","id":"f649c0af7d94c0fbbd895aa34","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"In what became known as the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre of 24 August \u2013 3 October 1572, Catholics killed thousands of Huguenots in Paris.

The church was eventually replaced by a third, Trinity-St. Paul's Episcopal Church, which contains heirlooms including the original bell from the French Huguenot Church \"Eglise du St. Esperit\" on Pine Street in New York City, which is preserved as a relic in the tower room.

The result is the multiple expansion engine. Such engines use either three or four expansion stages and are known as triple and quadruple expansion engines respectively. These engines use a series of cylinders of progressively increasing diameter. These cylinders are designed to divide the work into equal shares for each expansion stage. As with the double expansion engine, if space is at a premium, then two smaller cylinders may be used for the low-pressure stage. Multiple expansion engines typically had the cylinders arranged inline, but various other formations were used. In the late 19th century, the Yarrow-Schlick-Tweedy balancing 'system' was used on some marine triple expansion engines. Y-S-T engines divided the low-pressure expansion stages between two cylinders, one at each end of the engine. This allowed the crankshaft to be better balanced, resulting in a smoother, faster-responding engine which ran with less vibration. This made the 4-cylinder triple-expansion engine popular with large passenger liners (such as the Olympic class), but this was ultimately replaced by the virtually vibration-free turbine engine.[citation needed]"},{"qas":[{"question":"Along with poppet valve gears, what type of gears utilized separate admission and exhaust valves to give ideal events?","id":"1fcfe60feb6d690b470545cef","answers":[{"text":"Corliss","answer_start":849},{"text":"patent valve","answer_start":87},{"text":"Corliss","answer_start":849}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Along with Stephenson and Walschaerts, what is an example of a simple motion?","id":"bc44bd3ebf7b13ee0fd0cb5c4","answers":[{"text":"Joy","answer_start":820},{"text":"Joy","answer_start":820},{"text":"Joy","answer_start":820}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How is lap provided by overlapping the admission side port?","id":"f8d8021dfaa9e0a7f45cd6e68","answers":[{"text":"lengthening rubbing surfaces of the valve","answer_start":461},{"text":"lengthening rubbing surfaces","answer_start":461},{"text":"lengthening rubbing surfaces of the valve","answer_start":461}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Corliss","answer_start":849}],"question":"What type of gears, along with poppet valve gears, utilized separate admission and leakage cutoffs to give ideal events?

The combined setup gave a fair approximation of the ideal events, at the expense of increased friction and wear, and the mechanism tended to be complicated. The usual compromise solution has been to provide lap by lengthening rubbing surfaces of the valve in such a way as to overlap the port on the admission side, with the effect that the exhaust side remains open for a longer period after cut-off on the admission side has occurred. This expedient has since been generally considered satisfactory for most purposes and makes possible the use of the simpler Stephenson, Joy and Walschaerts motions. Corliss, and later, poppet valve gears had separate admission and exhaust valves driven by trip mechanisms or cams profiled so as to give ideal events; most of these gears never succeeded outside of the stationary marketplace due to various other issues including leakage and more delicate mechanisms."},{"qas":[{"question":"What are sometimes present in the boiler's firebox crown?","id":"48d7b2da162bd8adbeb14b4cb","answers":[{"text":"Lead fusible plugs","answer_start":0},{"text":"Lead fusible plugs","answer_start":0},{"text":"Lead fusible plugs","answer_start":0}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What happens to the lead fusible plugs if the water level of the boiler drops?","id":"bf42ff0df3bbec5e5decdd97e","answers":[{"text":"melts","answer_start":179},{"text":"melts","answer_start":179},{"text":"the lead melts","answer_start":170}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What happens after the lead melts?","id":"d5848967cf6530fcd5f27d4b8","answers":[{"text":"steam escapes","answer_start":193},{"text":"steam escapes,","answer_start":193},{"text":"the steam escapes","answer_start":189}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"After the operators are warned by the escape of the steam, what may they then do?","id":"af0cecdb3dedc9e22452c2cf3","answers":[{"text":"manually suppress the fire","answer_start":244},{"text":"manually suppress the fire","answer_start":244},{"text":"manually suppress the fire","answer_start":244}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the escape of the steam unlikely to accomplish in all but the smallest boilers?","id":"0aaff834dc2fd01c6ee0633d4","answers":[{"text":"dampening the fire","answer_start":344},{"text":"dampening the fire","answer_start":344},{"text":"dampening the fire","answer_start":344}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Lead fusible plugs","answer_start":0}],"question":"What are sometimes present in the plug's firebox crown?","id":"aa2a2aba9dccf2f6eedff903d","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"melts","answer_start":179}],"question":"What happens to the lead fusible plugs if the water level of the fire drops?","id":"bdd2b360a0b94afea78adad26","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"steam escapes","answer_start":193}],"question":"What happens after the firebox melts?","id":"be34b8a4a91f9af347fe3e64a","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"manually suppress the fire","answer_start":244}],"question":"After the operators are warned by the escape of the firebox, what may they then do?","id":"94902d7fbf6f7c4f0c19fab92","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"dampening the fire","answer_start":344}],"question":"What is the escape of the firebox unlikely to accomplish in all but the smallest boilers?","id":"eabd996885dd5b5daf0fcc724","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Lead fusible plugs may be present in the crown of the boiler's firebox.

With the 3-cylinder compound arrangement, the LP cranks were either set at 90\u00b0 with the HP one at 135\u00b0 to the other two, or in some cases all three cranks were set at 120\u00b0.[citation needed]"},{"qas":[{"question":"What is a term for the reversing of steam flow in a piston engine after each stroke?","id":"39c9d9a16a9dc052dbfb685ff","answers":[{"text":"counterflow","answer_start":95},{"text":"counterflow","answer_start":95},{"text":"counterflow","answer_start":95}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How many piston strokes occur in an engine cycle?","id":"d96cfdf8fd13cc585cf5df3d1","answers":[{"text":"two","answer_start":234},{"text":"two","answer_start":234},{"text":"two","answer_start":234}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How many crank rotations are there in an engine cycle?","id":"fb2eeed448cc593cddf6b3fee","answers":[{"text":"one","answer_start":204},{"text":"one","answer_start":204},{"text":"one","answer_start":204}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How many events occur in an engine cycle?","id":"fd9b3e645b7dc5afc38a5bc3c","answers":[{"text":"four","answer_start":279},{"text":"four","answer_start":279},{"text":"four","answer_start":279}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Along with admission, exhaust and compression, what is an event in the engine cycle?","id":"baffeb5f1fa8fc562cd89f8ae","answers":[{"text":"expansion","answer_start":304},{"text":"expansion","answer_start":304},{"text":"expansion","answer_start":304}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"counterflow","answer_start":95}],"question":"What is a term for the reversing of steam flow in a compression engine after each stroke?","id":"fdfeddda77f0bbe705b7051f6","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"two","answer_start":234}],"question":"How many piston strokes occur in an exhaust cycle?","id":"eafa583cae6ba83b30aab8e6a","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"one","answer_start":204}],"question":"How many crank rotations are there in a cylinder cycle?","id":"91328bbe637c5a3ce8cb9adab","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"four","answer_start":279}],"question":"How many events occur in a steam cycle?","id":"6a9392af4ded3ad2dfebbf3f8","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"expansion","answer_start":304}],"question":"What, along with admission, exhaust, and compression, is an event in the steam cycle?","id":"87772dfba2ec3e7f0f3c610cb","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"In most reciprocating piston engines, the steam reverses its direction of flow at each stroke (counterflow), entering and exhausting from the cylinder by the same port.

In the compound engine, high-pressure steam from the boiler expands in a high-pressure (HP) cylinder and then enters one or more subsequent lower-pressure (LP) cylinders. The complete expansion of the steam now occurs across multiple cylinders and as less expansion now occurs in each cylinder less heat is lost by the steam in each. This reduces the magnitude of cylinder heating and cooling, increasing the efficiency of the engine. By staging the expansion in multiple cylinders, torque variability can be reduced. To derive equal work from lower-pressure steam requires a larger cylinder volume as this steam occupies a greater volume. Therefore, the bore, and often the stroke, are increased in low-pressure cylinders resulting in larger cylinders."},{"qas":[{"question":"What percentage of electricity was made by steam turbine in the 1990s?","id":"a61a3d1847f6dfdc9cf5ab78c","answers":[{"text":"90","answer_start":81},{"text":"90%","answer_start":81},{"text":"90%","answer_start":81}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What marine engines were less efficient than steam turbines?","id":"fdd0037dcc21d55a6ec1d2ae3","answers":[{"text":"reciprocating steam engines","answer_start":826},{"text":"reciprocating","answer_start":826},{"text":"reciprocating steam engines","answer_start":826}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Along with diesel engines, what engines have overtaken steam engines for marine propulsion?","id":"cb26bfad4aab6be72dce1d3dc","answers":[{"text":"gas turbines","answer_start":908},{"text":"gas turbines","answer_start":908},{"text":"gas turbines","answer_start":908}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What engines were used throughout most of the 20th century to propel ships?","id":"a61f0232dcf6adfbfebf9683a","answers":[{"text":"steam turbines","answer_start":575},{"text":"steam turbines with reduction gearing","answer_start":575},{"text":"steam turbines","answer_start":575}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What gearing was used on steam turbine marine engines in the 20th century?","id":"df66ab2c5fface28bbefd7ac8","answers":[{"text":"reduction","answer_start":595},{"text":"reduction","answer_start":595},{"text":"reduction","answer_start":595}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"90","answer_start":81}],"question":"What percentage of electricity was made by power plants in the 1990s?","id":"d1ee6e3f7fca69e991dc7affc","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"reciprocating steam engines","answer_start":826}],"question":"What marine engines were less efficient than gas turbines?","id":"ec9f12ca7bba9b5d880b6ccc0","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"gas turbines","answer_start":908}],"question":"What engines, along with diesel engines, have overtaken steam engines for gas propulsion?","id":"cf19edf3dfc4fbcafaca89f21","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"steam turbines","answer_start":326}],"question":"What engines were used throughout most of the 20th century to propel power plants?","id":"ccedcd2bc401cb86c0bd34ba3","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"reduction","answer_start":678}],"question":"What gearing was used on steam turbine engines until the 1990s?","id":"e4fa04e5b2eb89db3e6ab149e","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"The main use for steam turbines is in electricity generation (in the 1990s about 90% of the world's electric production was by use of steam turbines) however the recent widespread application of large gas turbine units and typical combined cycle power plants has resulted in reduction of this percentage to the 80% regime for steam turbines.

A dry type cooling tower is similar to an automobile radiator and is used in locations where water is costly. Evaporative (wet) cooling towers use the rejected heat to evaporate water; this water is kept separate from the condensate, which circulates in a closed system and returns to the boiler. Such towers often have visible plumes due to the evaporated water condensing into droplets carried up by the warm air. Evaporative cooling towers need less water flow than \"once-through\" cooling by river or lake water; a 700 megawatt coal-fired power plant may use about 3600 cubic metres of make-up water every hour for evaporative cooling, but would need about twenty times as much if cooled by river water.[citation needed]"},{"qas":[{"question":"What did Watt add to the steam engine in 1788?","id":"685c4c91772d2303accce0241","answers":[{"text":"centrifugal governor","answer_start":4},{"text":"centrifugal governor","answer_start":4},{"text":"centrifugal governor","answer_start":4}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What was the name of Watt's partner?","id":"937146cc9f2e7a6ddaa5bd26f","answers":[{"text":"Boulton","answer_start":106},{"text":"Boulton","answer_start":106},{"text":"Boulton","answer_start":106}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where was the centrifugal governor first observed by Boulton?","id":"51f6af33f82cd8e06fcffb659","answers":[{"text":"flour mill","answer_start":127},{"text":"flour mill","answer_start":127},{"text":"a flour mill","answer_start":125}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is an examine of work that a centrifugal governor-equipped steam engine wasn't suitable for?","id":"ef1fd193e9cf3e1acdba1cdde","answers":[{"text":"cotton spinning","answer_start":608},{"text":"operations requiring constant speed","answer_start":563},{"text":"cotton spinning","answer_start":608}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What was the centrifugal governor incapable of doing?","id":"dd6e3eff136fde6b6cbc58682","answers":[{"text":"hold a set speed","answer_start":200},{"text":"hold a set speed","answer_start":200},{"text":"hold a set speed","answer_start":200}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"centrifugal governor","answer_start":4}],"question":"What did Watt add to the steam engine in 19th century?","id":"abd2fcd1d8deeead9871d8cfd","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Boulton","answer_start":106}],"question":"What was the name of Watt's boss?","id":"d5655daeabaee6fac8f3fe30e","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"flour mill","answer_start":127}],"question":"Where was the centrifugal governor first observed by Watt?","id":"78a54e9b97aca3ea2fdae82af","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"cotton spinning","answer_start":608}],"question":"What is an example of work that a centrifugal governor-equipped steam engine was suitable for?","id":"b813e2246fd0ed143354443e3","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"hold a set speed","answer_start":200}],"question":"What were the centrifugal changes in load incapable of doing?","id":"7df7a5b47bfebec6c8ebc6c71","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"The centrifugal governor was adopted by James Watt for use on a steam engine in 1788 after Watt\u2019s partner Boulton saw one at a flour mill Boulton & Watt were building.

The governor was able to handle smaller variations such as those caused by fluctuating heat load to the boiler. Also, there was a tendency for oscillation whenever there was a speed change. As a consequence, engines equipped only with this governor were not suitable for operations requiring constant speed, such as cotton spinning.

The rotors have a propeller-like arrangement of blades at the outer edge. Steam acts upon these blades, producing rotary motion. The stator consists of a similar, but fixed, series of blades that serve to redirect the steam flow onto the next rotor stage. A steam turbine often exhausts into a surface condenser that provides a vacuum. The stages of a steam turbine are typically arranged to extract the maximum potential work from a specific velocity and pressure of steam, giving rise to a series of variably sized high- and low-pressure stages. Turbines are only efficient if they rotate at relatively high speed, therefore they are usually connected to reduction gearing to drive lower speed applications, such as a ship's propeller. In the vast majority of large electric generating stations, turbines are directly connected to generators with no reduction gearing. Typical speeds are 3600 revolutions per minute (RPM) in the USA with 60 Hertz power, 3000 RPM in Europe and other countries with 50 Hertz electric power systems. In nuclear power applications the turbines typically run at half these speeds, 1800 RPM and 1500 RPM. A turbine rotor is also only capable of providing power when rotating in one direction. Therefore, a reversing stage or gearbox is usually required where power is required in the opposite direction.[citation needed]"},{"qas":[{"question":"What is the power-to-weight ratio of a steam plant compared to that of an internal combustion engine?","id":"eb0dbf6ced34959deeabf60d1","answers":[{"text":"lower","answer_start":96},{"text":"lower","answer_start":96},{"text":"lower","answer_start":96},{"text":"lower","answer_start":96}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Along with internal combustion engines, what machines have superseded steam in some areas?","id":"22fe21bfec64b745cbc282684","answers":[{"text":"electric motors","answer_start":232},{"text":"electric motors","answer_start":232},{"text":"internal combustion engines or electric motors","answer_start":201},{"text":"electric motors","answer_start":232}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What plants create most electric power?","id":"cf21ebaebfe3fad74d4caeedb","answers":[{"text":"steam turbine","answer_start":297},{"text":"steam turbine","answer_start":297},{"text":"steam turbine plant","answer_start":297},{"text":"steam turbine plant","answer_start":297}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the name of the movement that seeks renewed use of steam power in the modern era?","id":"eea3acaab1586c96bc0681759","answers":[{"text":"Advanced Steam","answer_start":581},{"text":"Advanced Steam movement","answer_start":581},{"text":"cogeneration processes","answer_start":506},{"text":"Advanced Steam movement","answer_start":581}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Along with fuel sources, what concern has contributed to the development of the Advanced Steam movement?","id":"adb3cedfbe73251a72a1174e8","answers":[{"text":"pollution","answer_start":432},{"text":"pollution","answer_start":432},{"text":"Advanced Steam movement","answer_start":581},{"text":"pollution","answer_start":432}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"lower","answer_start":96}],"question":"What is the power-to-weight ratio of a steam plant compared to that of a steam engine?","id":"dd820e61cf331abb513ab32ea","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"electric motors","answer_start":232}],"question":"Along with internal combustion engines, what machines have superseded power in some areas?","id":"daaceaaf5f0b8ee87d5e552aa","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"steam turbine","answer_start":297}],"question":"What plants create most combustion power?","id":"2e8a44cee4df24abe2fccb89a","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Advanced Steam","answer_start":581}],"question":"What is the name of the movement that seeks renewed use of combustion power in the modern era?","id":"c16ed3ef0aba8ff6e29d627ea","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"pollution","answer_start":432}],"question":"Along with fuel sources, what concern has contributed to the development of the combustion movement?","id":"e8f8bfba168b76efc6bcc2fc2","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"The weight of boilers and condensers generally makes the power-to-weight ratio of a steam plant lower than for internal combustion engines.

Such safety valves traditionally used a simple lever to restrain a plug valve in the top of a boiler. One end of the lever carried a weight or spring that restrained the valve against steam pressure. Early valves could be adjusted by engine drivers, leading to many accidents when a driver fastened the valve down to allow greater steam pressure and more power from the engine. The more recent type of safety valve uses an adjustable spring-loaded valve, which is locked such that operators may not tamper with its adjustment unless a seal illegally is broken. This arrangement is considerably safer.[citation needed]"},{"qas":[{"question":"What was the ultimate development of the horizontal engine?","id":"fd603ce285e24d73ecd437efb","answers":[{"text":"Corliss steam engine","answer_start":42},{"text":"Corliss","answer_start":42},{"text":"the Corliss steam engine","answer_start":38}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"In what year was the Corliss engine patented?","id":"64124c05128e307cd9e4078d2","answers":[{"text":"1849","answer_start":76},{"text":"1849","answer_start":76},{"text":"1849","answer_start":76}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How many valves did the Corliss engine use?","id":"bb7beadad93a2aedf8ac44eab","answers":[{"text":"four","answer_start":94},{"text":"four","answer_start":94},{"text":"four","answer_start":94}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What award was given to Corliss?","id":"7907adc788d9aabcd7a8fdb1a","answers":[{"text":"Rumford medal","answer_start":238},{"text":"Rumford medal","answer_start":238},{"text":"the Rumford medal","answer_start":234}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How much less steam did the Corliss engine use compared to the Watt engine?","id":"e8adfaef2c58e80ec4c2ecea0","answers":[{"text":"30%","answer_start":386},{"text":"30% less steam","answer_start":386},{"text":"30%","answer_start":386}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Corliss steam engine","answer_start":42}],"question":"What was the ultimate development of the vertical engine?","id":"dc5cfac1e8fec5be6db0ac828","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"1849","answer_start":76}],"question":"In what year was the Rumford engine patented?","id":"9ddbd3f8b58762966a5aeef8b","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"four","answer_start":94}],"question":"How many valves did the Rumford engine use?","id":"bcddcf717aecb0aa361fdf0bb","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Rumford medal","answer_start":238}],"question":"What award was inspired by Corliss?","id":"e4695d7f5afdd20bebdb7bdec","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"30%","answer_start":386}],"question":"How much less steam did the Rumford engine use compared to the Watt engine?","id":"ce70cefacd2a7ad7cef6ca7a7","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"The acme of the horizontal engine was the Corliss steam engine, patented in 1849, which was a four-valve counter flow engine with separate steam admission and exhaust valves and automatic variable steam cutoff.

The main difference is that heat addition (in the boiler) and rejection (in the condenser) are isobaric (constant pressure) processes in the Rankine cycle and isothermal (constant temperature) processes in the theoretical Carnot cycle. In this cycle a pump is used to pressurize the working fluid which is received from the condenser as a liquid not as a gas. Pumping the working fluid in liquid form during the cycle requires a small fraction of the energy to transport it compared to the energy needed to compress the working fluid in gaseous form in a compressor (as in the Carnot cycle). The cycle of a reciprocating steam engine differs from that of turbines because of condensation and re-evaporation occurring in the cylinder or in the steam inlet passages."}]},{"title":"1973_oil_crisis","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"When did the 1973 oil crisis begin?","id":"68048aae85a9fdd563ce6facd","answers":[{"text":"October 1973","answer_start":29},{"text":"October 1973","answer_start":29},{"text":"October 1973","answer_start":29},{"text":"October","answer_start":29},{"text":"1973","answer_start":37}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What was the price of oil in March of 1974?","id":"61987aa9facca35edcff0eea3","answers":[{"text":"nearly $12","answer_start":305},{"text":"$12","answer_start":312},{"text":"$12","answer_start":312},{"text":"$12","answer_start":312},{"text":"$12","answer_start":312}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"When was the second oil crisis?","id":"faa6c211b4d01e912694a2efa","answers":[{"text":"1979","answer_start":550},{"text":"1979","answer_start":550},{"text":"1979","answer_start":550},{"text":"1979","answer_start":550},{"text":"1979","answer_start":550}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What was another term used for the oil crisis?","id":"c36a7cb2af738e86e965f58a0","answers":[{"text":"first oil shock","answer_start":516},{"text":"shock","answer_start":401},{"text":"shock","answer_start":401},{"text":"first oil shock","answer_start":516},{"text":"shock","answer_start":401}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who proclaimed the oil embargo?","id":"dc18fdc262bcfce2c50ec9c6d","answers":[{"text":"members of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries","answer_start":51},{"text":"members of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries","answer_start":51},{"text":"Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries","answer_start":66},{"text":"members of the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries","answer_start":51},{"text":"OAPEC","answer_start":118}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"October 1973","answer_start":29}],"question":"When did OPEC begin?","id":"b91cd9feeb7f0b687bef7b3df","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"proclaimed an oil embargo","answer_start":186}],"question":"What action did the US begin that started the second oil shock?","id":"74a4ac39e0973ceb1a5384604","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"$3 per barrel","answer_start":288}],"question":"What was the price of oil in 1979 before it rose?","id":"f9ce7507fbb1f88abeac456bc","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"nearly $12","answer_start":305}],"question":"What did the price of oil rise to in 1979 globally?","id":"f8d77353d3c5a81d9ee182ac0","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the \"second oil shock","answer_start":574}],"question":"What is the term that describes what  happened in 1979 when the US prices of oil were higher?","id":"1dff8d0537f2e3f48d6dd6bb7","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"October","answer_start":29}],"question":"What month did the oil crisis begin?

Saudi Arabia and Iran became increasingly dependent on American security assurances to manage both external and internal threats, including increased military competition between them over increased oil revenues. Both states were competing for preeminence in the Persian Gulf and using increased revenues to fund expanded militaries. By 1979, Saudi arms purchases from the US exceeded five times Israel's. Another motive for the large scale purchase of arms from the US by Saudi Arabia was the failure of the Shah during January 1979 to maintain control of Iran, a non-Arabic but largely Shiite Muslim nation, which fell to a theocratic Islamist government under the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in the wake of the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, is an Arab, largely Sunni Muslim nation headed by a near absolutist monarchy. In the wake of the Iranian revolution the Saudis were forced to deal with the prospect of internal destabilization via the radicalism of Islamism, a reality which would quickly be revealed in the seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca by Wahhabi extremists during November 1979 and a Shiite revolt in the oil rich Al-Hasa region of Saudi Arabia in December of the same year.

The Commission oversees departments and various agencies that execute or enforce EU law. The \"European Council\" (rather than the Council, made up of different government Ministers) is composed of the Prime Ministers or executive Presidents of the member states. It appoints the Commissioners and the board of the European Central Bank. The European Court of Justice is the supreme judicial body which interprets EU law, and develops it through precedent.

European Union law also applies in territories where a member state is responsible for external relations, for example Gibraltar and the \u00c5land islands.

The TEU specifically excludes certain regions, for example the Faroe Islands, from the jurisdiction of European Union law. Treaties apply as soon as they enter into force, unless stated otherwise, and are generally concluded for an unlimited period. The TEU provides that commitments entered into by the member states between themselves before the treaty was signed no longer apply.[vague] All EU member states are regarded as subject to the general obligation of the principle of cooperation, as stated in the TEU, whereby member states are obliged not to take measure which could jeopardise the attainment of the TEU objectives.

Article 17(1) of the Treaty on European Union states the Commission should \"promote the general interest of the Union\" while Article 17(3) adds that Commissioners should be \"completely independent\" and not \"take instructions from any Government\". Under article 17(2), \"Union legislative acts may only be adopted on the basis of a Commission proposal, except where the Treaties provide otherwise.\" This means that the Commission has a monopoly on initiating the legislative procedure, although the Council is the \"de facto catalyst of many legislative initiatives\". The Parliament can also formally request the Commission to submit a legislative proposal but the Commission can reject such a suggestion, giving reasons. The Commission's President (currently an ex-Luxembourg Prime Minister, Jean-Claude Juncker) sets the agenda for the EU's work. Decisions are taken by a simple majority vote, usually through a \"written procedure\" of circulating the proposals and adopting if there are no objections.[citation needed] Since Ireland refused to consent to changes in the Treaty of Lisbon 2007, there remains one Commissioner for each of the 28 member states, including the President and the High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy (currently Federica Mogherini). The Commissioners (and most importantly, the portfolios they will hold) are bargained over intensively by the member states. The Commissioners, as a block, are then subject to a qualified majority vote of the Council to approve, and majority approval of the Parliament. The proposal to make the Commissioners be drawn from the elected Parliament, was not adopted in the Treaty of Lisbon. This means Commissioners are, through the appointment process, the unelected subordinates of member state governments."},{"qas":[{"question":"What commission was censured in 1999, and paved the way for Commissioners to abuse their power?","id":"d4eefa9cee06f71c1c8d51cdc","answers":[{"text":"the Santer Commission","answer_start":255},{"text":"the Santer Commission","answer_start":255},{"text":"the Santer Commission","answer_start":255},{"text":"the Santer Commission","answer_start":255}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Did the European Court of Justice rule the defendant in the case of Commission v.

Commissioners have sometimes been found to have abused their offices, particularly since the Santer Commission was censured by Parliament in 1999, and it eventually resigned due to corruption allegations. This resulted in one main case, Commission v Edith Cresson where the European Court of Justice held that a Commissioner giving her dentist a job, for which he was clearly unqualified, did in fact not break any law. By contrast to the ECJ's relaxed approach, a Committee of Independent Experts found that a culture had developed where few Commissioners had \u2018even the slightest sense of responsibility\u2019. This led to the creation of the European Anti-fraud Office. In 2012 it investigated the Maltese Commissioner for Health, John Dalli, who quickly resigned after allegations that he received a \u20ac60m bribe in connection with a Tobacco Products Directive. Beyond the Commission, the European Central Bank has relative executive autonomy in its conduct of monetary policy for the purpose of managing the euro.

It meets each six months and its President (currently former Poland Prime Minister Donald Tusk) is meant to 'drive forward its work', but it does not itself 'legislative functions'. The Council does this: in effect this is the governments of the member states, but there will be a different minister at each meeting, depending on the topic discussed (e.g. for environmental issues, the member states' environment ministers attend and vote; for foreign affairs, the foreign ministers, etc.). The minister must have the authority to represent and bin the member states in decisions. When voting takes place it is weighted inversely to member state size, so smaller member states are not dominated by larger member states. In total there are 352 votes, but for most acts there must be a qualified majority vote, if not consensus.

The essence is there are three readings, starting with a Commission proposal, where the Parliament must vote by a majority of all MEPs (not just those present) to block or suggest changes, and the Council must vote by qualified majority to approve changes, but by unanimity to block Commission amendment. Where the different institutions cannot agree at any stage, a \"Conciliation Committee\" is convened, representing MEPs, ministers and the Commission to try and get agreement on a joint text: if this works, it will be sent back to the Parliament and Council to approve by absolute and qualified majority. This means, legislation can be blocked by a majority in Parliament, a minority in the Council, and a majority in the Commission: it is harder to change EU law than stay the same. A different procedure exists for budgets. For \"enhanced cooperation\" among a sub-set of at least member states, authorisation must be given by the Council. Member state governments should be informed by the Commission at the outset before any proposals start the legislative procedure. The EU as a whole can only act within its power set out in the Treaties. TEU articles 4 and 5 state that powers remain with the member states unless they have been conferred, although there is a debate about the Kompetenz-Kompetenz question: who ultimately has the \"competence\" to define the EU's \"competence\".

played an important role in the development of EU law, by assuming the task of interpreting the treaties, and accelerating economic and political integration. Today the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) is the main judicial body, within which there is a higher European Court of Justice (commonly abbreviated as ECJ) that deals with cases that contain more public importance, and a General Court that deals with issues of detail but without general importance. There is also a Civil Service Tribunal to deal with EU staff issues, and then a separate Court of Auditors. Under the Treaty on European Union article 19(2) there is one judge from each member state, 28 at present, who are supposed to \"possess the qualifications required for appointment to the highest judicial offices\" (or for the General Court, the \"ability required for appointment to high judicial office\"). A president is elected by the judges for three years. Under TEU article 19(3) is to be the ultimate court to interpret questions of EU law. In fact, most EU law is applied by member state courts (the English Court of Appeal, the German Bundesgerichtshof, the Belgian Cour du travail, etc.) but they can refer questions to the EU court for a preliminary ruling. The CJEU's duty is to \"ensure that in the interpretation and application of the Treaties the law is observed\", although realistically it has the ability to expand and develop the law according to the principles it deems to be appropriate.

This has meant both the European Court of Justice and the highest national courts have had to develop principles to resolve conflicts of laws between different systems. Within the EU itself, the Court of Justice's view is that if EU law conflicts with a provision of national law, then EU law has primacy. In the first major case in 1964, Costa v ENEL, a Milanese lawyer, and former shareholder of an energy company, named Mr Costa refused to pay his electricity bill to Enel, as a protest against the nationalisation of the Italian energy corporations. He claimed the Italian nationalisation law conflicted with the Treaty of Rome, and requested a reference be made to both the Italian Constitutional Court and the Court of Justice under TFEU article 267. The Italian Constitutional Court gave an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962, and the treaty was in force from 1958, Costa had no claim. By contrast, the Court of Justice held that ultimately the Treaty of Rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation, and in any case under the Treaty provisions only the Commission could have brought a claim, not Mr Costa. However, in principle, Mr Costa was entitled to plead that the Treaty conflicted with national law, and the court would have a duty to consider his claim to make a reference if there would be no appeal against its decision. The Court of Justice, repeating its view in Van Gend en Loos, said member states \"albeit within limited spheres, have restricted their sovereign rights and created a body of law applicable both to their nationals and to themselves\" on the \"basis of reciprocity\". EU law would not \"be overridden by domestic legal provisions, however framed... without the legal basis of the community itself being called into question.\" This meant any \"subsequent unilateral act\" of the member state inapplicable. Similarly, in Amministrazione delle Finanze v Simmenthal SpA, a company, Simmenthal SpA, claimed that a public health inspection fee under an Italian law of 1970 for importing beef from France to Italy was contrary to two Regulations from 1964 and 1968. In \"accordance with the principle of the precedence of Community law,\" said the Court of Justice, the \"directly applicable measures of the institutions\" (such as the Regulations in the case) \"render automatically inapplicable any conflicting provision of current national law\". This was necessary to prevent a \"corresponding denial\" of Treaty \"obligations undertaken unconditionally and irrevocably by member states\", that could \"imperil the very foundations of the\" EU. But despite the views of the Court of Justice, the national courts of member states have not accepted the same analysis."},{"qas":[{"question":"What do all member states agree takes precedence over national law?","id":"9b14452d99c31e1d2abf8a38f","answers":[{"text":"EU law","answer_start":59},{"text":"EU law","answer_start":59},{"text":"EU law","answer_start":59},{"text":"EU law","answer_start":59}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What issues do member states say the Court of Justice does not have the final say on?","id":"cba8c66fe692fcd1dec461dfa","answers":[{"text":"foundational constitutional questions affecting democracy and human rights","answer_start":199},{"text":"foundational constitutional questions affecting democracy and human rights","answer_start":199},{"text":"foundational constitutional questions affecting democracy and human rights","answer_start":199},{"text":"on foundational constitutional questions affecting democracy and human rights","answer_start":196}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"When was the European Communities Act created?","id":"d0ccef8f9a7e6d9c771cb16ed","answers":[{"text":"1972","answer_start":1297},{"text":"1972","answer_start":742},{"text":"1972","answer_start":742},{"text":"1972","answer_start":742}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"In what cases can the EU not override German law?","id":"6c1765d3bbf26e47b14beca0f","answers":[{"text":"if the EU does not comply with its basic constitutional rights and principles","answer_start":1399},{"text":"if the EU does not comply with its basic constitutional rights and principles","answer_start":1399},{"text":"if the EU does not comply with its basic constitutional rights and principles","answer_start":1399}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What does the EU's legitimacy rest on?","id":"e1a7c9ed9cefcf828b0c7c4e6","answers":[{"text":"the ultimate authority of member states, its factual commitment to human rights, and the democratic will of the people.","answer_start":1966},{"text":"the ultimate authority of member states, its factual commitment to human rights, and the democratic will of the people","answer_start":1966},{"text":"the ultimate authority of member states","answer_start":1966},{"text":"the ultimate authority of member states","answer_start":1966}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"has the final say on foundational constitutional questions affecting democracy and human rights","answer_start":178}],"question":"What does the EU accept about the Court Justice?","id":"e8fc8b2cc23daa3b6d78cff2e","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"as the sovereign expression of democratic legitimacy, can decide whether it wishes to expressly legislate against EU law","answer_start":338}],"question":"What is the basic principle of the Canadian Parliament?","id":"c5db08ab8111cdd71df657fe8","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"1972","answer_start":742}],"question":"When was the European Communities Act denied acceptance?","id":"7f4bae7b87e4abc5decfeeabe","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the rule of law and the social state principles) then it cannot override German law","answer_start":1502}],"question":"What was not the view of the German Constitutional Court from Solange I and Solange II?","id":"fdeffcbeb43dd19d37a828492","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the ultimate authority of member states, its factual commitment to human rights, and the democratic will of the people.","answer_start":1966}],"question":"What does the EU's legitimacy not rest on?","id":"aee536cebb210d8eb28fe4e61","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Generally speaking, while all member states recognise that EU law takes primacy over national law where this agreed in the Treaties, they do not accept that the Court of Justice has the final say on foundational constitutional questions affecting democracy and human rights. In the United Kingdom, the basic principle is that Parliament, as the sovereign expression of democratic legitimacy, can decide whether it wishes to expressly legislate against EU law. This, however, would only happen in the case of an express wish of the people to withdraw from the EU. It was held in R (Factortame Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport that \"whatever limitation of its sovereignty Parliament accepted when it enacted the European Communities Act 1972 was entirely voluntary\" and so \"it has always been clear\" that UK courts have a duty \"to override any rule of national law found to be in conflict with any directly enforceable rule of Community law.\" More recently the UK Supreme Court noted that in R (HS2 Action Alliance Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport, although the UK constitution is uncodified, there could be \"fundamental principles\" of common law, and Parliament \"did not either contemplate or authorise the abrogation\" of those principles when it enacted the European Communities Act 1972. The view of the German Constitutional Court from the Solange I and Solange II decisions is that if the EU does not comply with its basic constitutional rights and principles (particularly democracy, the rule of law and the social state principles) then it cannot override German law. However, as the nicknames of the judgments go, \"so long as\" the EU works towards the democratisation of its institutions, and has a framework that protects fundamental human rights, it would not review EU legislation for compatibility with German constitutional principles. Most other member states have expressed similar reservations. This suggests the EU's legitimacy rests on the ultimate authority of member states, its factual commitment to human rights, and the democratic will of the people."},{"qas":[{"question":"Which type of law makes EU institutions and its member states follow the law?","id":"a8c0dc4ffd21d1becac6af7c7","answers":[{"text":"administrative law","answer_start":77},{"text":"administrative law","answer_start":77},{"text":"administrative law","answer_start":77}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"During what year were citizens or corporations said to not be able to bring claims against other non state parties?","id":"fde72bb7adf2bfbcd25ef7fdc","answers":[{"text":"1986","answer_start":688},{"text":"1986","answer_start":688},{"text":"1986","answer_start":688}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which actions by EU institutions can be subject to judicial review?","id":"a7d6fad54d7204bf6d889d6d2","answers":[{"text":"All actions","answer_start":1095},{"text":"All actions by EU institutions can be subject to judicial review","answer_start":1095},{"text":"All actions","answer_start":1095}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which type of law concerns the EU's governance structure?","id":"3d7e893e90dc6bb446fbca037","answers":[{"text":"constitutional law","answer_start":6},{"text":"constitutional law","answer_start":6},{"text":"constitutional law","answer_start":6}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"administrative law","answer_start":77}],"question":"What type of law does not make Eu institutions and member states follow the law?","id":"81353fac8d1c9785f1c682eca","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"1986","answer_start":688}],"question":"What year were citizens or corporations said to have been able to bring claims against other non state parties?","id":"1764878866eec2da1dce94bff","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"courts of member states","answer_start":771}],"question":"Who was bound to apply an EU law where a national rule conflicted?","id":"a8cd2b24b9b5559add22a9bb7","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"All actions","answer_start":1095}],"question":"Which actions by EU institutions were not subject to judicial review?","id":"cda1bd13e21efcb9435fb6a58","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"constitutional law","answer_start":6}],"question":"Which type of law did not concern the Eu's governance structure?","id":"2af8b05275cb6fd53f0501aec","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"While constitutional law concerns the European Union's governance structure, administrative law binds EU institutions and member states to follow the law.

This meant courts of member states were not bound to apply an EU law where a national rule conflicted, even though the member state government could be sued, if it would impose an obligation on another citizen or corporation. These rules on \"direct effect\" limit the extent to which member state courts are bound to administer EU law. All actions by EU institutions can be subject to judicial review, and judged by standards of proportionality, particularly where general principles of law, or fundamental rights are engaged. The remedy for a claimant where there has been a breach of the law is often monetary damages, but courts can also require specific performance or will grant an injunction, in order to ensure the law is effective as possible."},{"qas":[{"question":"In which case was it held that the provisions of the treaties are directly effective if they are clear, unconditional, and don't require further action by EU or national authorities?","id":"ffc51b5dfe5abeaaafca2cef1","answers":[{"text":"Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen","answer_start":165},{"text":"Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen","answer_start":165},{"text":"Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen","answer_start":165}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which TEFU article states that no quantitative restrictions can be placed on trade?","id":"7da3bc9c6d838e1c3f1aabf19","answers":[{"text":"article 30","answer_start":1087},{"text":"TFEU article 30","answer_start":530},{"text":"TFEU article 30","answer_start":530}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What type of company is Van Gend en Loos?","id":"9e1c3f9fe3ffb207fd764b576","answers":[{"text":"a postal company","answer_start":487},{"text":"a postal company","answer_start":487},{"text":"a postal company","answer_start":487}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What are EU Regulations essentially the same as in the case mentioned?","id":"faf7ebadcfa30c8b7bcebefd1","answers":[{"text":"Treaty provisions","answer_start":1332},{"text":"EU Regulations are the same as Treaty provisions in this sense, because as TFEU article 288 states, they are \u2018directly applicable in all Member States\u2019","answer_start":1301},{"text":"they are \u2018directly applicable in all Member States\u2019","answer_start":1401}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"has primacy","answer_start":46}],"question":"What is generally not accepted about EU law?","id":"6f1b2b54425febab993a14d24","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Van Gend en Loos","answer_start":1236}],"question":"Who could not recover the money it paid for the tariff?","id":"854c4cdc2dcbb073bfeba0113","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"they are \u2018directly applicable in all Member States","answer_start":1401}],"question":"What does TFEU article not state?","id":"a47d8eef67a92eace454c72f1","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Although it is generally accepted that EU law has primacy, not all EU laws give citizens standing to bring claims: that is, not all EU laws have \"direct effect\". In Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen it was held that the provisions of the Treaties (and EU Regulations) are directly effective, if they are (1) clear and unambiguous (2) unconditional, and (3) did not require EU or national authorities to take further action to implement them. Van Gend en Loos, a postal company, claimed that what is now TFEU article 30 prevented the Dutch Customs Authorities charging tariffs, when it imported urea-formaldehyde plastics from Germany to the Netherlands. After a Dutch court made a reference, the Court of Justice held that even though the Treaties did not \"expressly\" confer a right on citizens or companies to bring claims, they could do so. Historically, international treaties had only allowed states to have legal claims for their enforcement, but the Court of Justice proclaimed \"the Community constitutes a new legal order of international law\". Because article 30 clearly, unconditionally and immediately stated that no quantitative restrictions could be placed on trade, without a good justification, Van Gend en Loos could recover the money it paid for the tariff. EU Regulations are the same as Treaty provisions in this sense, because as TFEU article 288 states, they are \u2018directly applicable in all Member States\u2019. Moreover, member states comes under a duty not to replicate Regulations in their own law, in order to prevent confusion. For instance, in Commission v Italy the Court of Justice held that Italy had breached a duty under the Treaties, both by failing to operate a scheme to pay farmers a premium to slaughter cows (to reduce dairy overproduction), and by reproducing the rules in a decree with various additions. \"Regulations,\" held the Court of Justice, \"come into force solely by virtue of their publication\" and implementation could have the effect of \"jeopardizing their simultaneous and uniform application in the whole of the Union.\" On the other hand, some Regulations may themselves expressly require implementing measures, in which case those specific rules should be followed."},{"qas":[{"question":"What generally does not allow citizens to sue other citizens?","id":"b3108dbaaec3a7e701fec3b5b","answers":[{"text":"Directives","answer_start":100},{"text":"Directives","answer_start":100},{"text":"Directives","answer_start":100}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How many paid holiday days does the Working Time directive require workers to have each year?","id":"4fbbdafcc6f95364beb86bf7a","answers":[{"text":"4 weeks","answer_start":594},{"text":"4 weeks paid holidays each year","answer_start":594},{"text":"4 weeks paid","answer_start":594}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How many paid holiday days do most member states require?","id":"6e8ecf2467ecab21ecf4e6a28","answers":[{"text":"28 days","answer_start":668},{"text":"more than 28 days","answer_start":658},{"text":"more than 28 days","answer_start":658}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"When did the three Advocate Generals argue that Directives should create rights and duties for all citizens?","id":"6fcdccc3b3dfd2a0fbf6711ec","answers":[{"text":"early 1990s","answer_start":1027},{"text":"the early 1990s","answer_start":1023},{"text":"early 1990s","answer_start":1027}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Directives","answer_start":100}],"question":"What generally does allow citizens to sue other citizens?","id":"3096e09a1d7aed92b940a1e59","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Directives are addressed to the member states and usually \"leave to the national authorities the choice of form and methods\" to implement","answer_start":256}],"question":"What does TFEU article 288 not say?","id":"67234acabdd5d982d979c35c9","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"4 weeks","answer_start":594}],"question":"How many non paid holidays does the Working time directive require workers to have each year?","id":"28a84e0a8c7c7ffabaa40c8fd","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Working Time Directive","answer_start":531}],"question":"What does not require more than 28 days in national law?","id":"4ebbeb05c8b1c86bcf2dfa38e","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"While the Treaties and Regulations will have direct effect (if clear, unconditional and immediate), Directives do not generally give citizens (as opposed to the member state) standing to sue other citizens. In theory, this is because TFEU article 288 says Directives are addressed to the member states and usually \"leave to the national authorities the choice of form and methods\" to implement. In part this reflects that directives often create minimum standards, leaving member states to apply higher standards. For example, the Working Time Directive requires that every worker has at least 4 weeks paid holidays each year, but most member states require more than 28 days in national law. However, on the current position adopted by the Court of Justice, citizens have standing to make claims based on national laws that implement Directives, but not from Directives themselves. Directives do not have so called \"horizontal\" direct effect (i.e. between non-state parties). This view was instantly controversial, and in the early 1990s three Advocate Generals persuasively argued that Directives should create rights and duties for all citizens.

So, in Pubblico Ministero v Ratti because the Italian government had failed to implement a Directive 73\/173\/EEC on packaging and labelling solvents by the deadline, it was estopped from enforcing a conflicting national law from 1963 against Mr Ratti's solvent and varnish business. A member state could \"not rely, as against individuals, on its own failure to perform the obligations which the Directive entails.\" Second, a citizen or company can invoke a Directive, not just in a dispute with a public authority, but in a dispute with another citizen or company. So, in CIA Security v Signalson and Securitel the Court of Justice held that a business called CIA Security could defend itself from allegations by competitors that it had not complied with a Belgian decree from 1991 about alarm systems, on the basis that it had not been notified to the Commission as a Directive required. Third, if a Directive gives expression to a \"general principle\" of EU law, it can be invoked between private non-state parties before its deadline for implementation. This follows from K\u00fcc\u00fckdeveci v Swedex GmbH & Co KG where the German Civil Code \u00a7622 stated that the years people worked under the age of 25 would not count towards the increasing statutory notice before dismissal. Ms K\u00fcc\u00fckdeveci worked for 10 years, from age 18 to 28, for Swedex GmbH & Co KG before her dismissal. She claimed that the law not counting her years under age 25 was unlawful age discrimination under the Employment Equality Framework Directive. The Court of Justice held that the Directive could be relied on by her because equality was also a general principle of EU law. Third, if the defendant is an emanation of the state, even if not central government, it can still be bound by Directives. In Foster v British Gas plc the Court of Justice held that Mrs Foster was entitled to bring a sex discrimination claim against her employer, British Gas plc, which made women retire at age 60 and men at 65, if (1) pursuant to a state measure, (2) it provided a public service, and (3) had special powers. This could also be true if the enterprise is privatised, as it was held with a water company that was responsible for basic water provision."},{"qas":[{"question":"Which courts have a duty to interpret domestic law as far as possible?","id":"036d96b028fffaeaabcb28b3e","answers":[{"text":"national courts","answer_start":8},{"text":"national courts","answer_start":8},{"text":"national courts","answer_start":8}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What does the First Company Law Directive article 11 require?","id":"317f6572dbba9fefcc49ddf8e","answers":[{"text":"incorporations would only be nullified for a fixed list of reasons","answer_start":478},{"text":"incorporations would only be nullified for a fixed list of reasons","answer_start":478},{"text":"incorporations would only be nullified for a fixed list of reasons","answer_start":478}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What did the Italian government fail to do in Francovich v Italy?","id":"2afad36ca7cd1354fa3dc75e6","answers":[{"text":"failed to set up an insurance fund for employees to claim unpaid wages if their employers had gone insolvent","answer_start":939},{"text":"to set up an insurance fund for employees to claim unpaid wages if their employers had gone insolvent, as the Insolvency Protection Directive required","answer_start":946},{"text":"to set up an insurance fund for employees to claim unpaid wages if their employers had gone insolvent, as the Insolvency Protection Directive required","answer_start":946}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How much money was Francovich allowed to claim from the Italian goverment in damages?","id":"9ee7f0cf16d9d8b74afdba686","answers":[{"text":"6 million Lira","answer_start":1190},{"text":"6 million Lira","answer_start":1190},{"text":"6 million Lira","answer_start":1190}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"national courts","answer_start":8}],"question":"Which courts do not have a duty to interpret  domestic law as far a possible?","id":"ae08d0495fd1dddebc8f87321","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"incorporations would only be nullified for a fixed list of reasons","answer_start":478}],"question":"What does the First Company Law Directive article 11 not require?","id":"cefacd5bbaac12c3fde4faa0f","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"that the duty of interpretation cannot contradict plain words in a national statute","answer_start":588}],"question":"What did the Court of Justice not acknowledge?","id":"44bff8fad9bda08f6a9d2222a","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"to set up an insurance fund for employees to claim unpaid wages if their employers had gone insolvent","answer_start":946}],"question":"What did the Italian government not fail to do in Francovich v Italy?","id":"1ec94449ffb310c1b6ddc8243","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"6 million Lira","answer_start":1190}],"question":"How much money did Francovich not allowed to claim from the Italian government in claims?","id":"1ceb505aacd8984bdb7458b5b","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Fourth, national courts have a duty to interpret domestic law \"as far as possible in the light of the wording and purpose of the directive\". Textbooks (though not the Court itself) often called this \"indirect effect\". In Marleasing SA v La Comercial SA the Court of Justice held that a Spanish Court had to interpret its general Civil Code provisions, on contracts lacking cause or defrauding creditors, to conform with the First Company Law Directive article 11, that required incorporations would only be nullified for a fixed list of reasons. The Court of Justice quickly acknowledged that the duty of interpretation cannot contradict plain words in a national statute. But, fifth, if a member state has failed to implement a Directive, a citizen may not be able to bring claims against other non-state parties, but can sue the member state itself for failure to implement the law. So, in Francovich v Italy, the Italian government had failed to set up an insurance fund for employees to claim unpaid wages if their employers had gone insolvent, as the Insolvency Protection Directive required. Francovich, the former employee of a bankrupt Venetian firm, was therefore allowed to claim 6 million Lira from the Italian government in damages for his loss. The Court of Justice held that if a Directive would confer identifiable rights on individuals, and there is a causal link between a member state's violation of EU and a claimant's loss, damages must be paid.

The adoption of laws which will have legal effect in the European Union must have a proper legal basis. Legislation in member states which implements European Union law must be worded so that it is clearly understandable by those who are subject to the law. In European Union law the general principle of legal certainty prohibits Ex post facto laws, i.e. laws should not take effect before they are published. The doctrine of legitimate expectation, which has its roots in the principles of legal certainty and good faith, is also a central element of the general principle of legal certainty in European Union law.

This was the first time that competition law principles were included in a plurilateral regional agreement and established the trans-European model of competition law.

The Treaty of Rome established the enactment of competition law as one of the main aims of the EEC through the \"institution of a system ensuring that competition in the common market is not distorted\". The two central provisions on EU competition law on companies were established in article 85, which prohibited anti-competitive agreements, subject to some exemptions, and article 86 prohibiting the abuse of dominant position.

Article 107 lays down a general rule that the state may not aid or subsidise private parties in distortion of free competition and provides exemptions for charities, regional development objectives and in the event of a natural disaster."},{"qas":[{"question":"When was the concept of a social market economy introduced into EU law?","id":"c9b091a8bf8ebf7774a56ad31","answers":[{"text":"2007","answer_start":82},{"text":"2007","answer_start":82},{"text":"2007","answer_start":82}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How long has free movement and trade been central to European development?","id":"bd57f3cfc1baa3cda4df6096f","answers":[{"text":"1957","answer_start":174},{"text":"1957","answer_start":174},{"text":"since the Treaty of Rome 1957","answer_start":149}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Breaking down barriers to trade and enhancing the free movement of goods is meant to reduce what?","id":"0cfc59df5fcb5d7fcdd7eef8c","answers":[{"text":"consumer prices","answer_start":589},{"text":"consumer prices","answer_start":589},{"text":"reduce consumer prices","answer_start":582}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What do the Treaties generally limit?","id":"d9699fd9d67f03a0a0e5ede6d","answers":[{"text":"free trade","answer_start":1975},{"text":"free trade","answer_start":1975},{"text":"free trade","answer_start":1975}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":" What entity has taken the view that the goals of free trade are underpinned by the aims to improve people's well being?","id":"273b4efd0f0d5ce2f66fcaeab","answers":[{"text":"the Court of Justice","answer_start":2135},{"text":"the Court of Justice","answer_start":2135},{"text":"the Court of Justice","answer_start":2135}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the concept of a \"social market economy","answer_start":6}],"question":"What was not introduced into EU law in 2007?","id":"0fec4edbdd9ecef894bc1dbe5","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"free movement and trade","answer_start":88}],"question":"What was not central to European development since the Treaty of Rome 1957?","id":"64f4fdbdcc0ec3cdcf40acb12","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"had a tendency to give way to a customs union,","answer_start":657}],"question":"What was not originally theorised about a free trade area?","id":"226b905b9edafc50df3fd6e45","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"free trade","answer_start":641}],"question":"What do the treaties not limit?","id":"8fb16c33efcd8bcae77befe1f","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the Court of Justice","answer_start":2135}],"question":"What entity has not taken the view that the specific goal of free trade are to underpinned by the general aims of improvement of people's well being?","id":"cb8de3124e004fdccdd2b94bd","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"While the concept of a \"social market economy\" was only introduced into EU law in 2007, free movement and trade were central to European development since the Treaty of Rome 1957. According to the standard theory of comparative advantage, two countries can both benefit from trade even if one of them has a less productive economy in all respects. Like in other regional organisations such as the North American Free Trade Association, or the World Trade Organisation, breaking down barriers to trade, and enhancing free movement of goods, services, labour and capital, is meant to reduce consumer prices. It was originally theorised that a free trade area had a tendency to give way to a customs union, which led to a common market, then monetary union, then union of monetary and fiscal policy, political and eventually a full union characteristic of a federal state. In Europe, however, those stages were considerably mixed, and it remains unclear whether the \"endgame\" should be the same as a state, traditionally understood. In practice free trade, without standards to ensure fair trade, can benefit some people and groups within countries (particularly big business) much more than others, but will burden people who lack bargaining power in an expanding market, particularly workers, consumers, small business, developing industries, and communities. The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union articles 28 to 37 establish the principle of free movement of goods in the EU, while articles 45 to 66 require free movement of persons, services and capital. These so-called \"four freedoms\" were thought to be inhibited by physical barriers (e.g. customs), technical barriers (e.g. differing laws on safety, consumer or environmental standards) and fiscal barriers (e.g. different Value Added Tax rates). The tension in the law is that the free movement and trade is not supposed to spill over into a licence for unrestricted commercial profit. The Treaties limit free trade, to prioritise other values such as public health, consumer protection, labour rights, fair competition, and environmental improvement. Increasingly the Court of Justice has taken the view that the specific goals of free trade are underpinned by the general aims of the treaty for improvement of people's well being."},{"qas":[{"question":"What helps the process of free movement of goods?","id":"d7d57fe85aa695d52dd3edfbe","answers":[{"text":"a customs union, and the principle of non-discrimination","answer_start":64},{"text":"a customs union","answer_start":64},{"text":"a customs union","answer_start":64}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What did did article 34 discriminate against in Procureur du Roi v Dassonville?","id":"c94ff49c7c41cec7d22ddc7df","answers":[{"text":"parallel importers like Mr Dassonville","answer_start":839},{"text":"parallel importers","answer_start":839},{"text":"parallel importers","answer_start":839}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Article 34 meant states could be responsible for what?","id":"0175285efba004a4fa3ae7fb7","answers":[{"text":"private actors","answer_start":1229},{"text":"private actors","answer_start":1229},{"text":"private actors","answer_start":1229}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"In which case were French vigilantes sabotaging shipments of Spanish Strawberries?","id":"bbc9b49cdbbfadacc00a38245","answers":[{"text":"Commission v France","answer_start":1262},{"text":"Commission v France French","answer_start":1262},{"text":"Commission v France French","answer_start":1262}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"In Schmidberger v Austria, the Court of Justice came to the conclusion that Austria didn't infringe upon article 34 by failing to ban a what?","id":"292e1d01c477fdce19ebca8b4","answers":[{"text":"a protest that blocked heavy traffic","answer_start":2366},{"text":"a protest","answer_start":2366},{"text":"a protest","answer_start":2366}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"a customs union, and the principle of non-discrimination","answer_start":64}],"question":"What does not help the free movement of goods?","id":"471744f6ffe5beccf5c442faa","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"duties","answer_start":169}],"question":"What is not prohibited between member states?","id":"64dc4bea75c2b9902803fe743","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"imports","answer_start":137}],"question":"What the the EU not manage from non-member states?","id":"e8e9ca3eba72facf4dd1cbf04","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"private actors","answer_start":1229}],"question":"What were states not responsible for in Article 34?","id":"290746deddd2cd0f0b0ff953c","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Commission v France","answer_start":1262}],"question":"What case were French vigilantes helping shipments of Spanish Strawberries?","id":"21ef51f1ed6cbcbf0a9dd79e4","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Free movement of goods within the European Union is achieved by a customs union, and the principle of non-discrimination. The EU manages imports from non-member states, duties between member states are prohibited, and imports circulate freely. In addition under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 34, \u2018Quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect shall be prohibited between Member States\u2019. In Procureur du Roi v Dassonville the Court of Justice held that this rule meant all \"trading rules\" that are \"enacted by Member States\" which could hinder trade \"directly or indirectly, actually or potentially\" would be caught by article 34. This meant that a Belgian law requiring Scotch whisky imports to have a certificate of origin was unlikely to be lawful. It discriminated against parallel importers like Mr Dassonville, who could not get certificates from authorities in France, where they bought the Scotch. This \"wide test\", to determine what could potentially be an unlawful restriction on trade, applies equally to actions by quasi-government bodies, such as the former \"Buy Irish\" company that had government appointees. It also means states can be responsible for private actors. For instance, in Commission v France French farmer vigilantes were continually sabotaging shipments of Spanish strawberries, and even Belgian tomato imports. France was liable for these hindrances to trade because the authorities \u2018manifestly and persistently abstained' from preventing the sabotage. Generally speaking, if a member state has laws or practices that directly discriminate against imports (or exports under TFEU article 35) then it must be justified under article 36. The justifications include public morality, policy or security, \"protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants\", \"national treasures\" of \"artistic, historic or archaeological value\" and \"industrial and commercial property.\" In addition, although not clearly listed, environmental protection can justify restrictions on trade as an overriding requirement derived from TFEU article 11. More generally, it has been increasingly acknowledged that fundamental human rights should take priority over all trade rules. So, in Schmidberger v Austria the Court of Justice held that Austria did not infringe article 34 by failing to ban a protest that blocked heavy traffic passing over the A13, Brenner Autobahn, en route to Italy. Although many companies, including Mr Schmidberger's German undertaking, were prevented from trading, the Court of Justice reasoned that freedom of association is one of the \u2018fundamental pillars of a democratic society\u2019, against which the free movement of goods had to be balanced, and was probably subordinate. If a member state does appeal to the article 36 justification, the measures it takes have to be applied proportionately. This means the rule must be pursue a legitimate aim and (1) be suitable to achieve the aim, (2) be necessary, so that a less restrictive measure could not achieve the same result, and (3) be reasonable in balancing the interests of free trade with interests in article 36."},{"qas":[{"question":"What is the minimum percent of alcohol content a German law requires all spirits and liqueurs to have?","id":"ca1fee6fa8ac3ee4a7f0d0e70","answers":[{"text":"25","answer_start":710},{"text":"25 per cent","answer_start":710},{"text":"25 per cent","answer_start":710}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which country did Rewe-Zentrale AG wish to import from?","id":"2b86fbfcdef7a6b300440dc01","answers":[{"text":"France","answer_start":921},{"text":"France","answer_start":921},{"text":"France","answer_start":921}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which year was the case Commission v Italy that dealt with cocoa products?","id":"0bea176b3efe5e60a04bac5fc","answers":[{"text":"2003","answer_start":1790},{"text":"2003","answer_start":1790},{"text":"2003","answer_start":1790}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"All Italian chocolate is made from what alone?","id":"d7dbcfe1f07addd5b06d37c3f","answers":[{"text":"cocoa butter","answer_start":2007},{"text":"cocoa butter","answer_start":2007},{"text":"cocoa butter","answer_start":2007}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":" In the 2009 Commission v Italy, case, the Court of Justice held that an Italian low prohibiting what infringed article 34?","id":"9adbfc3a3eacfecbcbc3bc324","answers":[{"text":"motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers","answer_start":2568},{"text":"motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers","answer_start":2568},{"text":"motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers","answer_start":2568}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"25 per cent","answer_start":710}],"question":"What was maximum percent of alcohol content a German law requires all spirits and liqueurs to have?","id":"e53b11af8427da3b3c02d73b8","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"France","answer_start":921}],"question":"Which country dod Rewe-Zentrale AG not wish to import from?","id":"ff5e2a9ac9a1ecc1900a6d4f9","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"The Court of Justice","answer_start":965}],"question":"Who accepted the German government's arguments that the measure proportional protected public health?","id":"aa6ada453ecffefe5ca3e2c4a","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"did not justify a \"chocolate substitute\" label","answer_start":2203}],"question":"What did the Court of Justice justify about a low content of vegetable fat?","id":"c18abbf2abdfbbaee7029fdb2","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Often rules apply to all goods neutrally, but may have a greater practical effect on imports than domestic products. For such \"indirect\" discriminatory (or \"indistinctly applicable\") measures the Court of Justice has developed more justifications: either those in article 36, or additional \"mandatory\" or \"overriding\" requirements such as consumer protection, improving labour standards, protecting the environment, press diversity, fairness in commerce, and more: the categories are not closed. In the most famous case Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol f\u00fcr Branntwein, the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe-Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The Court of Justice rejected the German government's arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36, because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought. This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product's content or packaging. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. The argument that Belgians would believe it was butter if it was not cube shaped was disproportionate: it would \"considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view\" and labelling would protect consumers \"just as effectively\". In a 2003 case, Commission v Italy Italian law required that cocoa products that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as \"chocolate\". It had to be \"chocolate substitute\". All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone, but British, Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats. They claimed the law infringed article 34. The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a \"chocolate substitute\" label. This was derogatory in the consumers' eyes. A \u2018neutral and objective statement\u2019 was enough to protect consumers. If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product, this can also infringe article 34. So, in a 2009 case, Commission v Italy, the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34. Again, the law applied neutrally to everyone, but disproportionately affected importers, because Italian companies did not make trailers. This was not a product requirement, but the Court reasoned that the prohibition would deter people from buying it: it would have \"a considerable influence on the behaviour of consumers\" that \"affects the access of that product to the market\". It would require justification under article 36, or as a mandatory requirement."},{"qas":[{"question":"Which two importers claimed that under a French competition law, they were prevented from selling Picon beer under wholesale price?","id":"05150cbaacfef8aafec78723b","answers":[{"text":"Keck and Mithouard","answer_start":291},{"text":"Keck and Mithouard","answer_start":291},{"text":"Keck and Mithouard","answer_start":291}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"The aim of the French competition law was to do what?","id":"8dc797c05a6acaeec2aa41290","answers":[{"text":"cut throat competition","answer_start":498},{"text":"prevent cut throat competition","answer_start":490},{"text":"prevent cut throat competition","answer_start":490}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"In which case did the Court of Justice review Swedish bans on advertising to young children under 12?","id":"f5e4db899bf459053bfddd3ee","answers":[{"text":"Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini","answer_start":990},{"text":"Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini","answer_start":990},{"text":"Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini","answer_start":990}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Under which Directive did the EU harmonize restrictions on restrictions on marketing and advertising?","id":"d3f8ab6d523faa5df79eee978","answers":[{"text":"the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive","answer_start":1866},{"text":"the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive","answer_start":1866},{"text":"the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive","answer_start":1866}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Keck and Mithouard","answer_start":291}],"question":"Which two importers did not claim that under French competition law, they were prevented from selling Picon beer under wholesale price?","id":"d4dabdd931baad7b7325c8d27","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"selling arrangements","answer_start":128}],"question":"What did the Court of Justice rule fell under TFEU article 34?","id":"b40e9afcdb92e95c4ad0aba94","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"to prevent cut throat competition, not to hinder trade","answer_start":487}],"question":"What was not the aim of the TFEU article 34 law?","id":"ce8deab35aaea01cc8dda5452","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini","answer_start":990}],"question":"Which case did the Court of Justice not review Swedish bans on advertising to young children und er 12?","id":"6cde9a197cec0fb61c7a6696e","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"In contrast to product requirements or other laws that hinder market access, the Court of Justice developed a presumption that \"selling arrangements\" would be presumed to not fall into TFEU article 34, if they applied equally to all sellers, and affected them in the same manner in fact. In Keck and Mithouard two importers claimed that their prosecution under a French competition law, which prevented them selling Picon beer under wholesale price, was unlawful. The aim of the law was to prevent cut throat competition, not to hinder trade. The Court of Justice held, as \"in law and in fact\" it was an equally applicable \"selling arrangement\" (not something that alters a product's content) it was outside the scope of article 34, and so did not need to be justified. Selling arrangements can be held to have an unequal effect \"in fact\" particularly where traders from another member state are seeking to break into the market, but there are restrictions on advertising and marketing. In Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini the Court of Justice reviewed Swedish bans on advertising to children under age 12, and misleading commercials for skin care products. While the bans have remained (justifiable under article 36 or as a mandatory requirement) the Court emphasised that complete marketing bans could be disproportionate if advertising were \"the only effective form of promotion enabling [a trader] to penetrate\" the market. In Konsumentombudsmannen v Gourmet AB the Court suggested that a total ban for advertising alcohol on the radio, TV and in magazines could fall within article 34 where advertising was the only way for sellers to overcome consumers' \"traditional social practices and to local habits and customs\" to buy their products, but again the national courts would decide whether it was justified under article 36 to protect public health. Under the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, the EU harmonised restrictions on restrictions on marketing and advertising, to forbid conduct that distorts average consumer behaviour, is misleading or aggressive, and sets out a list of examples that count as unfair. Increasingly, states have to give mutual recognition to each other's standards of regulation, while the EU has attempted to harmonise minimum ideals of best practice. The attempt to raise standards is hoped to avoid a regulatory \"race to the bottom\", while allowing consumers access to goods from around the continent."},{"qas":[{"question":"What have the Treaties sought to enable since its foundation?","id":"c1a4f6b02fcc2c6fadbacc3d3","answers":[{"text":"to enable people to pursue their life goals in any country through free movement","answer_start":42},{"text":"people to pursue their life goals in any country through free movement","answer_start":52},{"text":"Since its foundation","answer_start":0}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Which entity focused upon the free movement of workers?","id":"3d3fdb85ae2b15ee1d2c9cf15","answers":[{"text":"the European Community","answer_start":171},{"text":"the European Community","answer_start":171},{"text":"the European Community","answer_start":171}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What was free movement increasingly based on?","id":"09626b50ecfdfea29c04a94ee","answers":[{"text":"citizenship","answer_start":401},{"text":"\"citizenship\"","answer_start":400},{"text":"\"citizenship\"","answer_start":400}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"In which case did a German man claim the right to live in Netherlands where he was a volunteer plumber?","id":"d149c9b5cfd01f9ff28ddfc25","answers":[{"text":"Steymann v Staatssecretaris van Justitie","answer_start":1014},{"text":"Steymann v Staatssecretaris van Justitie","answer_start":1014},{"text":"Steymann v Staatssecretaris van Justitie","answer_start":1014}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What did the Court of Justice say Steymann was entitled to?","id":"46afed08b57f08fc561eb37c7","answers":[{"text":"to stay, so long as there was at least an \"indirect quid pro quo\" for the work he did","answer_start":1335},{"text":"stay","answer_start":1338},{"text":"stay","answer_start":1338}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"to enable people to pursue their life goals in any country through free movement","answer_start":42}],"question":"What did the Treaties not seek to do since its foundation?","id":"cfbeff7a8e9c46baa9bc35bad","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"free movement of workers: as a \"factor of production","answer_start":218}],"question":"What did the European Community not originally focus on?","id":"322dba3a54dbcebc8beaebefc","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"developing a more \"social\" Europe","answer_start":325}],"question":"What was focused on by the European Community in the 1980's?","id":"d35cd3afb793df9bcc24bdbac","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"so that people had rights to empower them to become economically and socially active, rather than economic activity","answer_start":415}],"question":"Why was free movement not increasingly based on citizenship?","id":"e5d995de4798c46efd7f562d1","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"stay","answer_start":1338}],"question":"What did the Court of Justice say that Mr. Steymann was not entitled to do?","id":"e4ab680a8b330c1b6286a75c4","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Since its foundation, the Treaties sought to enable people to pursue their life goals in any country through free movement. Reflecting the economic nature of the project, the European Community originally focused upon free movement of workers: as a \"factor of production\". However, from the 1970s, this focus shifted towards developing a more \"social\" Europe. Free movement was increasingly based on \"citizenship\", so that people had rights to empower them to become economically and socially active, rather than economic activity being a precondition for rights. This means the basic \"worker\" rights in TFEU article 45 function as a specific expression of the general rights of citizens in TFEU articles 18 to 21. According to the Court of Justice, a \"worker\" is anybody who is economically active, which includes everyone in an employment relationship, \"under the direction of another person\" for \"remuneration\". A job, however, need not be paid in money for someone to be protected as a worker. For example, in Steymann v Staatssecretaris van Justitie, a German man claimed the right to residence in the Netherlands, while he volunteered plumbing and household duties in the Bhagwan community, which provided for everyone's material needs irrespective of their contributions. The Court of Justice held that Mr Steymann was entitled to stay, so long as there was at least an \"indirect quid pro quo\" for the work he did. Having \"worker\" status means protection against all forms of discrimination by governments, and employers, in access to employment, tax, and social security rights. By contrast a citizen, who is \"any person having the nationality of a Member State\" (TFEU article 20(1)), has rights to seek work, vote in local and European elections, but more restricted rights to claim social security. In practice, free movement has become politically contentious as nationalist political parties have manipulated fears about immigrants taking away people's jobs and benefits (paradoxically at the same time).

First, articles 1 to 4 generally require that workers can take up employment, conclude contracts, and not suffer discrimination compared to nationals of the member state. In a famous case, the Belgian Football Association v Bosman, a Belgian footballer named Jean-Marc Bosman claimed that he should be able to transfer from R.F.C. de Li\u00e8ge to USL Dunkerque when his contract finished, regardless of whether Dunkerque could afford to pay Li\u00e8ge the habitual transfer fees. The Court of Justice held \"the transfer rules constitute[d] an obstacle to free movement\" and were unlawful unless they could be justified in the public interest, but this was unlikely. In Groener v Minister for Education the Court of Justice accepted that a requirement to speak Gaelic to teach in a Dublin design college could be justified as part of the public policy of promoting the Irish language, but only if the measure was not disproportionate. By contrast in Angonese v Cassa di Risparmio di Bolzano SpA a bank in Bolzano, Italy, was not allowed to require Mr Angonese to have a bilingual certificate that could only be obtained in Bolzano. The Court of Justice, giving \"horizontal\" direct effect to TFEU article 45, reasoned that people from other countries would have little chance of acquiring the certificate, and because it was \"impossible to submit proof of the required linguistic knowledge by any other means\", the measure was disproportionate. Second, article 7(2) requires equal treatment in respect of tax. In Finanzamt K\u00f6ln Altstadt v Schumacker the Court of Justice held that it contravened TFEU art 45 to deny tax benefits (e.g. for married couples, and social insurance expense deductions) to a man who worked in Germany, but was resident in Belgium when other German residents got the benefits. By contrast in Weigel v Finanzlandesdirektion f\u00fcr Vorarlberg the Court of Justice rejected Mr Weigel's claim that a re-registration charge upon bringing his car to Austria violated his right to free movement. Although the tax was \"likely to have a negative bearing on the decision of migrant workers to exercise their right to freedom of movement\", because the charge applied equally to Austrians, in absence of EU legislation on the matter it had to be regarded as justified. Third, people must receive equal treatment regarding \"social advantages\", although the Court has approved residential qualifying periods. In Hendrix v Employee Insurance Institute the Court of Justice held that a Dutch national was not entitled to continue receiving incapacity benefits when he moved to Belgium, because the benefit was \"closely linked to the socio-economic situation\" of the Netherlands. Conversely, in Geven v Land Nordrhein-Westfalen the Court of Justice held that a Dutch woman living in the Netherlands, but working between 3 and 14 hours a week in Germany, did not have a right to receive German child benefits, even though the wife of a man who worked full-time in Germany but was resident in Austria could. The general justifications for limiting free movement in TFEU article 45(3) are \"public policy, public security or public health\", and there is also a general exception in article 45(4) for \"employment in the public service\"."},{"qas":[{"question":"What has lately been being viewed as a fundamental status of member state nationals by the Court of Justice?","id":"c8cda58fde0aa9bbf6c22924c","answers":[{"text":"Citizenship of the EU","answer_start":0},{"text":"Citizenship of the EU","answer_start":0},{"text":"Citizenship of the EU","answer_start":0}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What has having an EU Citizenship increased?","id":"91a4a6547e0845cf16acb7ce0","answers":[{"text":"the number of social services that people can access wherever they move","answer_start":156},{"text":"the number of social services that people can access wherever they move","answer_start":156},{"text":"the number of social services that people can access wherever they move","answer_start":156}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"In which case did the Court state that Austria was not allowed to hold places in Austrian schools exclusively for Austrian students?","id":"bc2dea6b2d4d46d8ca7c83ebd","answers":[{"text":"Commission v Austria","answer_start":380},{"text":"Commission v Austria the Court","answer_start":380},{"text":"Commission v Austria","answer_start":380}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What has the Court required to be more accessible?","id":"42bbfbbeec1044eea2bdaeabc","answers":[{"text":"higher education","answer_start":257},{"text":"higher education","answer_start":257},{"text":"higher education","answer_start":257}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Citizenship of the EU","answer_start":0}],"question":"What has not been seen increasingly as a fundamental status of member state nationals by the Court of Justice?","id":"43fccaaca7c2d8adc4928b294","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the number of social services that people can access wherever they move","answer_start":156}],"question":"What has having an EU Citizenship decreased?","id":"b79d362d7d08f3b8b4cdf0c6b","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Commission v Austria","answer_start":380}],"question":"What case did the Court state that Austria was allowed to hold places in Austrian schools exclusivity for Austrian students?","id":"bcf117d3b6bd6a3db3a17e59f","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"higher education","answer_start":257}],"question":"What has the Court required to be less accessible?","id":"3daca3cdda0e8b5316b6c30fe","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Citizenship of the EU has increasingly been seen as a \"fundamental\" status of member state nationals by the Court of Justice, and has accordingly increased the number of social services that people can access wherever they move.

In Gebhard v Consiglio dell\u2019Ordine degli Avvocati e Procuratori di Milano the Court of Justice held that to be \"established\" means to participate in economic life \"on a stable and continuous basis\", while providing \"services\" meant pursuing activity more \"on a temporary basis\". This meant that a lawyer from Stuttgart, who had set up chambers in Milan and was censured by the Milan Bar Council for not having registered, was entitled to bring a claim under for establishment freedom, rather than service freedom. However, the requirements to be registered in Milan before being able to practice would be allowed if they were non-discriminatory, \"justified by imperative requirements in the general interest\" and proportionately applied. All people or entities that engage in economic activity, particularly the self-employed, or \"undertakings\" such as companies or firms, have a right to set up an enterprise without unjustified restrictions. The Court of Justice has held that both a member state government and a private party can hinder freedom of establishment, so article 49 has both \"vertical\" and \"horizontal\" direct effect. In Reyners v Belgium the Court of Justice held that a refusal to admit a lawyer to the Belgian bar because he lacked Belgian nationality was unjustified. TFEU article 49 says states are exempt from infringing others' freedom of establishment when they exercise \"official authority\", but this did an advocate's work (as opposed to a court's) was not official. By contrast in Commission v Italy the Court of Justice held that a requirement for lawyers in Italy to comply with maximum tariffs unless there was an agreement with a client was not a restriction. The Grand Chamber of the Court of Justice held the Commission had not proven that this had any object or effect of limiting practitioners from entering the market. Therefore, there was no prima facie infringement freedom of establishment that needed to be justified."},{"qas":[{"question":"In which year did a toxic waste spill from a European ship prompt the Commission to look into legislation against waste?","id":"dfdd8db6b4b5feb9eabe04a16","answers":[{"text":"2006","answer_start":3},{"text":"2006","answer_start":3},{"text":"2006","answer_start":3}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"At the time, countries such as Spain didn't have a crime against what?","id":"85753da0da5b51dbc6b9f4fb5","answers":[{"text":"shipping toxic waste","answer_start":334},{"text":"shipping toxic waste","answer_start":334},{"text":"toxic waste","answer_start":140}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"When did the Court of Justice rule that the Commission could only propose that there must be some criminal sanctions?","id":"95d47f7f1ad9dca79acb1763b","answers":[{"text":"October 2007","answer_start":1024},{"text":"2007","answer_start":1032},{"text":"2007","answer_start":1032}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"When was the competence for the Union to create criminal sentences for ecological crimes contested?","id":"be3619abe1fe71a2db1db25f3","answers":[{"text":"2005","answer_start":552},{"text":"2005","answer_start":552},{"text":"2005","answer_start":552}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"2006","answer_start":3}],"question":"What year did a toxic waste spill from an American ship prompt the Commission to look into legislation against waste?","id":"f7a324b5faffbf45fa393c8ee","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"shipping toxic waste","answer_start":334}],"question":"What did countries such as Spain have a crime against?","id":"b58a6fbb5ff6b23f15d7b6c9c","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"criminal sentences for \"ecological crimes\"","answer_start":451}],"question":"What did Franco Frattini, the Justice, Freedom and Security Commissioner, and Dimas reject?","id":"c42a7aab2649b3dee5cb9c53a","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"October 2007","answer_start":1024}],"question":"When did the Court of Justice deny that the Commission could only propose that there must some criminal sanctions?","id":"5d305db9cb33abff3ab9feba5","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"In 2006, a toxic waste spill off the coast of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, from a European ship, prompted the Commission to look into legislation against toxic waste.

With countries such as Spain not even having a crime against shipping toxic waste, Franco Frattini, the Justice, Freedom and Security Commissioner, proposed with Dimas to create criminal sentences for \"ecological crimes\". The competence for the Union to do this was contested in 2005 at the Court of Justice resulting in a victory for the Commission. That ruling set a precedent that the Commission, on a supranational basis, may legislate in criminal law \u2013 something never done before.

For example, in Van Binsbergen v Bestuur van de Bedrijfvereniging voor de Metaalnijverheid a Dutch lawyer moved to Belgium while advising a client in a social security case, and was told he could not continue because Dutch law said only people established in the Netherlands could give legal advice. The Court of Justice held that the freedom to provide services applied, it was directly effective, and the rule was probably unjustified: having an address in the member state would be enough to pursue the legitimate aim of good administration of justice. The Court of Justice has held that secondary education falls outside the scope of article 56, because usually the state funds it, though higher education does not. Health care generally counts as a service. In Geraets-Smits v Stichting Ziekenfonds Mrs Geraets-Smits claimed she should be reimbursed by Dutch social insurance for costs of receiving treatment in Germany. The Dutch health authorities regarded the treatment unnecessary, so she argued this restricted the freedom (of the German health clinic) to provide services. Several governments submitted that hospital services should not be regarded as economic, and should not fall within article 56. But the Court of Justice held health was a \"service\" even though the government (rather than the service recipient) paid for the service. National authorities could be justified in refusing to reimburse patients for medical services abroad if the health care received at home was without undue delay, and it followed \"international medical science\" on which treatments counted as normal and necessary. The Court requires that the individual circumstances of a patient justify waiting lists, and this is also true in the context of the UK's National Health Service. Aside from public services, another sensitive field of services are those classified as illegal. Josemans v Burgemeester van Maastricht held that the Netherlands' regulation of cannabis consumption, including the prohibitions by some municipalities on tourists (but not Dutch nationals) going to coffee shops, fell outside article 56 altogether. The Court of Justice reasoned that narcotic drugs were controlled in all member states, and so this differed from other cases where prostitution or other quasi-legal activity was subject to restriction. If an activity does fall within article 56, a restriction can be justified under article 52 or overriding requirements developed by the Court of Justice. In Alpine Investments BV v Minister van Financi\u00ebn a business that sold commodities futures (with Merrill Lynch and another banking firms) attempted to challenge a Dutch law that prohibiting cold calling customers. The Court of Justice held the Dutch prohibition pursued a legitimate aim to prevent \"undesirable developments in securities trading\" including protecting the consumer from aggressive sales tactics, thus maintaining confidence in the Dutch markets. In Omega Spielhallen GmbH v Bonn a \"laserdrome\" business was banned by the Bonn council. It bought fake laser gun services from a UK firm called Pulsar Ltd, but residents had protested against \"playing at killing\" entertainment. The Court of Justice held that the German constitutional value of human dignity, which underpinned the ban, did count as a justified restriction on freedom to provide services. In Liga Portuguesa de Futebol v Santa Casa da Miseric\u00f3rdia de Lisboa the Court of Justice also held that the state monopoly on gambling, and a penalty for a Gibraltar firm that had sold internet gambling services, was justified to prevent fraud and gambling where people's views were highly divergent. The ban was proportionate as this was an appropriate and necessary way to tackle the serious problems of fraud that arise over the internet. In the Services Directive a group of justifications were codified in article 16 that the case law has developed."},{"qas":[{"question":"Which newspaper's parent company could not evade tax by shifting its residence to the Netherlands?","id":"0e54633c8faabbc5cdb72ad41","answers":[{"text":"the Daily Mail","answer_start":224},{"text":"the Daily Mail","answer_start":224},{"text":"Daily Mail","answer_start":56}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How much capital did UK law require to start a company?","id":"de6bbfafbbba4e5eb2cf72b68","answers":[{"text":"\u00a31","answer_start":703},{"text":"\u00a31","answer_start":703},{"text":"\u00a31","answer_start":703}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How much capital did Danish law require to start a company?","id":"9a57bcebddc09fe3f5e57cfe9","answers":[{"text":"200,000 Danish krone","answer_start":827},{"text":"200,000 Danish krone","answer_start":827},{"text":"200,000 Danish krone","answer_start":827}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What could justify restrictions on freedom of establishment?","id":"7a1cd14c172a114bbbfaa0cd4","answers":[{"text":"creditor protection, labour rights to participate in work, or the public interest in collecting taxes","answer_start":1888},{"text":"creditor protection, labour rights to participate in work, or the public interest in collecting taxes","answer_start":1888},{"text":"Denmark's minimum capital law","answer_start":959}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"In which case did the Court of Justice hold that a German court couldn't deny a Dutch building company the right to enforce a contract based in Germany?","id":"9bf97bbe0c62a1c56b7cec720","answers":[{"text":"\u00dcberseering BV v Nordic Construction GmbH","answer_start":1583},{"text":"\u00dcberseering BV v Nordic Construction GmbH","answer_start":1583},{"text":"\u00dcberseering BV v Nordic Construction GmbH","answer_start":1583}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Court of Justice","answer_start":28}],"question":"Who riled that member stated could not restrict a company from moving its seat of business without infringing TFEU article 49?","id":"7f2c83bd241f6fefdaaadcb4e","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Daily Mail newspaper's parent company","answer_start":228}],"question":"Who could evade taxes by shifting its resident to the Netherlands?","id":"5dd9f15ab15fdfad5aad034cf","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"as rules on company seats were not yet harmonised","answer_start":422}],"question":"Why did the UK have to justify its actions?","id":"3f2aad2b5edeadcbab7cdfe9f","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"\u00a31","answer_start":703}],"question":"How much capital did the UK not require to start a company?","id":"3e2217f402a19fce2180cbac4","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"200,000 Danish krone","answer_start":827}],"question":"How much did Denmark not require to start a company?","id":"fe6ea91230d9fa10fbedc8efb","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"In regard to companies, the Court of Justice held in R (Daily Mail and General Trust plc) v HM Treasury that member states could restrict a company moving its seat of business, without infringing TFEU article 49. This meant the Daily Mail newspaper's parent company could not evade tax by shifting its residence to the Netherlands without first settling its tax bills in the UK. The UK did not need to justify its action, as rules on company seats were not yet harmonised. By contrast, in Centros Ltd v Erhversus-og Selkabssyrelsen the Court of Justice found that a UK limited company operating in Denmark could not be required to comply with Denmark's minimum share capital rules. UK law only required \u00a31 of capital to start a company, while Denmark's legislature took the view companies should only be started up if they had 200,000 Danish krone (around \u20ac27,000) to protect creditors if the company failed and went insolvent. The Court of Justice held that Denmark's minimum capital law infringed Centros Ltd's freedom of establishment and could not be justified, because a company in the UK could admittedly provide services in Denmark without being established there, and there were less restrictive means of achieving the aim of creditor protection. This approach was criticised as potentially opening the EU to unjustified regulatory competition, and a race to the bottom in standards, like in the US where the state Delaware attracts most companies and is often argued to have the worst standards of accountability of boards, and low corporate taxes as a result. Similarly in \u00dcberseering BV v Nordic Construction GmbH the Court of Justice held that a German court could not deny a Dutch building company the right to enforce a contract in Germany on the basis that it was not validly incorporated in Germany. Although restrictions on freedom of establishment could be justified by creditor protection, labour rights to participate in work, or the public interest in collecting taxes, denial of capacity went too far: it was an \"outright negation\" of the right of establishment. However, in Cartesio Oktat\u00f3 \u00e9s Szolg\u00e1ltat\u00f3 bt the Court of Justice affirmed again that because corporations are created by law, they are in principle subject to any rules for formation that a state of incorporation wishes to impose. This meant that the Hungarian authorities could prevent a company from shifting its central administration to Italy while it still operated and was incorporated in Hungary. Thus, the court draws a distinction between the right of establishment for foreign companies (where restrictions must be justified), and the right of the state to determine conditions for companies incorporated in its territory, although it is not entirely clear why."}]},{"title":"Packet_switching","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"What did Paul Baran develop ","id":"fd6cb7e3adee036fb4a8bcdbb","answers":[{"text":"Paul Baran developed the concept Distributed Adaptive Message Block Switching","answer_start":56},{"text":"the concept Distributed Adaptive Message Block Switching","answer_start":77},{"text":"Distributed Adaptive Message Block Switching","answer_start":89}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What did Distributed Adaptive Message Block Switching do","id":"8df7cb1c57ea297de5eec56fb","answers":[{"text":"provide a fault-tolerant, efficient routing method for telecommunication messages","answer_start":151},{"text":"provide a fault-tolerant, efficient routing method for telecommunication messages","answer_start":151},{"text":"fault-tolerant, efficient routing method","answer_start":161}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What did this concept contradict ","id":"ffdaa5b41e8da542a2ff0d336","answers":[{"text":"This concept contrasted and contradicted the theretofore established principles of pre-allocation of network bandwidth","answer_start":328},{"text":"theretofore established principles of pre-allocation of network bandwidth","answer_start":373},{"text":"principles of pre-allocation of network bandwidth","answer_start":397}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is Donald Davies credited with ","id":"cdb41ed0b3bd571dceda43e00","answers":[{"text":"Davies is credited with coining the modern name packet switching and inspiring numerous packet switching networks in Europe","answer_start":715},{"text":"coining the modern name packet switching and inspiring numerous packet switching networks","answer_start":739},{"text":"coining the modern name packet switching","answer_start":739}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What did Paul Baran develop in the late 1950's","id":"92ff5edb4eeafaacd8ade0bd7","answers":[{"text":"the concept Distributed Adaptive Message Block Switching","answer_start":77},{"text":"the concept Distributed Adaptive Message Block Switching","answer_start":77},{"text":"Distributed Adaptive Message Block Switching","answer_start":89}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What was the goal of the system ","id":"abeb713e618d7ce2a78197a6d","answers":[{"text":"to provide a fault-tolerant, efficient routing method for telecommunication messages","answer_start":148},{"text":"provide a fault-tolerant, efficient routing method for telecommunication messages","answer_start":151}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who is credited with the modern name for this system ","id":"59a5ada2fceae30012daf2efa","answers":[{"text":"Davies is credited with coining the modern name packet switching and inspiring numerous packet switching networks in Europe","answer_start":715},{"text":"Donald Davies","answer_start":623},{"text":"Donald Davies","answer_start":623}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Distributed Adaptive Message Block Switching","answer_start":89}],"question":"In the late 1950s what concept was developed?","id":"cd8eeb6ab7faad10aa196fcba","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"efficient routing method for telecommunication messages","answer_start":177}],"question":"What did the concept hope to achieve?","id":"179ccadf8cb9995b555bde6b3","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"funded by the US Department of Defense.","answer_start":288}],"question":"How much funding did the RAND Corporation receive?","id":"aac12a75afca746effbda2eee","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the development of telecommunications in the Bell System","answer_start":469}],"question":"What was the independent work of Donald Davis?","id":"cbad844deebcabbfcc4a52e47","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"development of telecommunications","answer_start":473}],"question":"What was the Bell System?","id":"8e554cf19fc065fab9beec4e9","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Distributed Adaptive Message Block Switching","answer_start":89}],"question":"What did the US Department of Defense gain from their funding to RAND Corporation?","id":"7efd2caaa2a6663cc3c8e49e5","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the RAND Corporation","answer_start":266}],"question":"Who credited Paul Baran for his development?

The new concept found little resonance among network implementers until the independent work of Donald Davies at the National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom) (NPL) in the late 1960s.

This precludes the need for a dedicated path to help the packet find its way to its destination, but means that much more information is needed in the packet header, which is therefore larger, and this information needs to be looked up in power-hungry content-addressable memory. Each packet is dispatched and may go via different routes; potentially, the system has to do as much work for every packet as the connection-oriented system has to do in connection set-up, but with less information as to the application's requirements. At the destination, the original message\/data is reassembled in the correct order, based on the packet sequence number.

But X.25 does it at the network layer of the OSI Model. Frame Relay does it at level two, the data link layer. Another major difference between X.25 and Frame Relay is that X.25 requires a handshake between the communicating parties before any user packets are transmitted. Frame Relay does not define any such handshakes. X.25 does not define any operations inside the packet network. It only operates at the user-network-interface (UNI). Thus, the network provider is free to use any procedure it wishes inside the network. X.25 does specify some limited re-transmission procedures at the UNI, and its link layer protocol (LAPB) provides conventional HDLC-type link management procedures. Frame Relay is a modified version of ISDN's layer two protocol, LAPD and LAPB. As such, its integrity operations pertain only between nodes on a link, not end-to-end. Any retransmissions must be carried out by higher layer protocols. The X.25 UNI protocol is part of the X.25 protocol suite, which consists of the lower three layers of the OSI Model. It was widely used at the UNI for packet switching networks during the 1980s and early 1990s, to provide a standardized interface into and out of packet networks. Some implementations used X.25 within the network as well, but its connection-oriented features made this setup cumbersome and inefficient. Frame relay operates principally at layer two of the OSI Model. However, its address field (the Data Link Connection ID, or DLCI) can be used at the OSI network layer, with a minimum set of procedures. Thus, it rids itself of many X.25 layer 3 encumbrances, but still has the DLCI as an ID beyond a node-to-node layer two link protocol. The simplicity of Frame Relay makes it faster and more efficient than X.25. Because Frame relay is a data link layer protocol, like X.25 it does not define internal network routing operations. For X.25 its packet IDs---the virtual circuit and virtual channel numbers have to be correlated to network addresses. The same is true for Frame Relays DLCI. How this is done is up to the network provider. Frame Relay, by virtue of having no network layer procedures is connection-oriented at layer two, by using the HDLC\/LAPD\/LAPB Set Asynchronous Balanced Mode (SABM). X.25 connections are typically established for each communication session, but it does have a feature allowing a limited amount of traffic to be passed across the UNI without the connection-oriented handshake. For a while, Frame Relay was used to interconnect LANs across wide area networks. However, X.25 and well as Frame Relay have been supplanted by the Internet Protocol (IP) at the network layer, and the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and or versions of Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) at layer two. A typical configuration is to run IP over ATM or a version of MPLS. <Uyless Black, X.25 and Related Protocols, IEEE Computer Society, 1991> <Uyless Black, Frame Relay Networks, McGraw-Hill, 1998> <Uyless Black, MPLS and Label Switching Networks, Prentice Hall, 2001> < Uyless Black, ATM, Volume I, Prentice Hall, 1995>"},{"qas":[{"question":"WHen did ARPNET and SITA become operational","id":"869fbdcb2ffa69d2fcfc335fc","answers":[{"text":"1969","answer_start":43},{"text":"1969","answer_start":43},{"text":"1969","answer_start":43}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"2 differences betwen X.25 and ARPNET CITA technologies ","id":"8ae4da3fd6b364ef9ff69533a","answers":[{"text":"Two fundamental differences involved the division of functions and tasks between the hosts at the edge of the network and the network core","answer_start":154},{"text":"the division of functions and tasks between the hosts at the edge of the network and the network core.","answer_start":191},{"text":"division of functions and tasks between the hosts at the edge of the network and the network core","answer_start":195}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"WHat does UserDatagram Protocol gaurentee","id":"be3ddf198fde18381ca5b8460","answers":[{"text":"In the virtual call system, the network guarantees sequenced delivery of data to the host","answer_start":462},{"text":"sequenced delivery of data to the host","answer_start":513},{"text":"sequenced delivery of data","answer_start":513}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"X.25 uses what type network type ","id":"7430baf925f2535f8634fa1d3","answers":[{"text":"User Datagram Protocol","answer_start":395},{"text":"the datagram model","answer_start":626},{"text":"UDP","answer_start":419}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"about twenty","answer_start":90}],"question":"How many different network technologies where there before 1973?","id":"bc61bdb426624a6d7007bbfd7","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"The User Datagram Protocol","answer_start":391}],"question":"What type of network does SITA HLN not use?","id":"a2cf5e4a49ead23dc6fb7af77","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"host interface","answer_start":579}],"question":"X.25 had a simpler what?","id":"28f6eeac0f2d024eff43f767a","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the datagram model","answer_start":626}],"question":"X.25 had less functionality because of what?","id":"c77c798cecca6abf6b0e60edf","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the hosts at the edge of the network and the network core","answer_start":235}],"question":"What defined the differences between the ARPANET and SITA HLN and X.25?","id":"94fafe3ca464ad6d7f40d011d","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"about twenty different network technologies had been developed","answer_start":90}],"question":"After the introduction of X.25 in 1973, how many network technologies had been developed?","id":"cea8659efd5f52ce9fffdc80d","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the network guarantees sequenced delivery of data to the host","answer_start":490}],"question":"In UDP, the network guarantees what?","id":"03acfc4dca4cb9ae52fded5db","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"The X.25 protocol suite uses this network type.","answer_start":646}],"question":"What suite uses UDP?","id":"6bbc4fc428f89ac7874c2104c","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the hosts have the responsibility to ensure orderly delivery of packets.","answer_start":318}],"question":"In a virtual call system, the hosts have what responsibility?","id":"6ede8bfdc8bb99bb825787eed","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"ARPANET and SITA HLN became operational in 1969.

With initial support from the State of Michigan and the National Science Foundation (NSF), the packet-switched network was first demonstrated in December 1971 when an interactive host to host connection was made between the IBM mainframe computer systems at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and Wayne State University in Detroit. In October 1972 connections to the CDC mainframe at Michigan State University in East Lansing completed the triad. Over the next several years in addition to host to host interactive connections the network was enhanced to support terminal to host connections, host to host batch connections (remote job submission, remote printing, batch file transfer), interactive file transfer, gateways to the Tymnet and Telenet public data networks, X.25 host attachments, gateways to X.25 data networks, Ethernet attached hosts, and eventually TCP\/IP and additional public universities in Michigan join the network.

Its curriculum and student body were gradually secularized during the 18th century, and by the 19th century Harvard had emerged as the central cultural establishment among Boston elites. Following the American Civil War, President Charles W. Eliot's long tenure (1869\u20131909) transformed the college and affiliated professional schools into a modern research university; Harvard was a founding member of the Association of American Universities in 1900.

Agassiz's approach was distinctly idealist and posited Americans' \"participation in the Divine Nature\" and the possibility of understanding \"intellectual existences\". Agassiz's perspective on science combined observation with intuition and the assumption that a person can grasp the \"divine plan\" in all phenomena. When it came to explaining life-forms, Agassiz resorted to matters of shape based on a presumed archetype for his evidence. This dual view of knowledge was in concert with the teachings of Common Sense Realism derived from Scottish philosophers Thomas Reid and Dugald Stewart, whose works were part of the Harvard curriculum at the time. The popularity of Agassiz's efforts to \"soar with Plato\" probably also derived from other writings to which Harvard students were exposed, including Platonic treatises by Ralph Cudworth, John Norrisand, in a Romantic vein, Samuel Coleridge. The library records at Harvard reveal that the writings of Plato and his early modern and Romantic followers were almost as regularly read during the 19th century as those of the \"official philosophy\" of the more empirical and more deistic Scottish school."},{"qas":[{"question":"What president eliminated the Christian position in the curriculum?","id":"ddcece40ee66ae77dee408186","answers":[{"text":"Charles W.

Forbes in March 2009 estimated the loss to be in the range of $12 billion. One of the most visible results of Harvard's attempt to re-balance its budget was their halting of construction of the $1.2 billion Allston Science Complex that had been scheduled to be completed by 2011, resulting in protests from local residents.

Wars and construction projects had drained the Mongol treasury. Efforts to raise and collect tax revenues were plagued by corruption and political scandals. Mishandled military expeditions followed the financial problems. Kublai's second invasion of Japan in 1281 failed because of an inauspicious typhoon. Kublai botched his campaigns against Annam, Champa, and Java, but won a Pyrrhic victory against Burma. The expeditions were hampered by disease, an inhospitable climate, and a tropical terrain unsuitable for the mounted warfare of the Mongols. The Tran dynasty which ruled Annam (Dai Viet) crushed and defeated the Mongols at the Battle of B\u1ea1ch \u0110\u1eb1ng (1288). The Chinese region of Fujian was the original home of the Chinese Tran (Chen) clan before they migrated under Tr\u1ea7n Kinh (\u9673\u4eac, Ch\u00e9n J\u012bng) to Dai Viet and whose descendants established the Tr\u1ea7n dynasty which ruled Vietnam \u0110\u1ea1i Vi\u1ec7t, and certain members of the clan could still speak Chinese such as when a Yuan dynasty envoy had a meeting with the Chinese-speaking Tr\u1ea7n prince Tr\u1ea7n Qu\u1ed1c Tu\u1ea5n (later King Tr\u1ea7n H\u01b0ng \u0110\u1ea1o) in 1282.

The Tran dynasty originated from the Fujian region of China as did the Daoist cleric Xu Zongdao who recorded the Mongol invasion and referred to them as \"Northern bandits\".

The Chinese-style elements of the bureaucracy mainly came from the native Tang, Song, as well as Khitan Liao and Jurchen Jin dynasties. Chinese advisers such as Liu Bingzhong and Yao Shu gave strong influence to Kublai's early court, and the central government administration was established within the first decade of Kublai's reign. This government adopted the traditional Chinese tripartite division of authority among civil, military, and censorial offices, including the Central Secretariat (Zhongshu Sheng) to manage civil affairs, the Privy Council (Chinese: \u6a1e\u5bc6\u9662) to manage military affairs, and the Censorate to conduct internal surveillance and inspection. The actual functions of both central and local government institutions, however, showed a major overlap between the civil and military jurisdictions, due to the Mongol traditional reliance on military institutions and offices as the core of governance. Nevertheless, such a civilian bureaucracy, with the Central Secretariat as the top institution that was (directly or indirectly) responsible for most other governmental agencies (such as the traditional Chinese-style Six Ministries), was created in China.

Often in terms of the further development of landscape painting as well as the classical joining together of the arts of painting, poetry, and calligraphy, the Song dynasty and the Yuan dynasty are linked together. In the area of Chinese painting during the Yuan dynasty there were many famous painters. In the area of calligraphy many of the great calligraphers were from the Yuan dynasty era. In Yuan poetry, the main development was the qu, which was used among other poetic forms by most of the famous Yuan poets. Many of the poets were also involved in the major developments in the theater during this time, and the other way around, with people important in the theater becoming famous through the development of the sanqu type of qu. One of the key factors in the mix of the zaju variety show was the incorporation of poetry both classical and of the newer qu form. One of the important cultural developments during the Yuan era was the consolidation of poetry, painting, and calligraphy into a unified piece of the type that tends to come to mind when people think of classical Chinese art. Another important aspect of Yuan times is the increasing incorporation of the then current, vernacular Chinese into both the qu form of poetry and the zaju variety show.

The establishment of the Yuan dynasty had dramatically increased the number of Muslims in China. However, unlike the western khanates, the Yuan dynasty never converted to Islam. Instead, Kublai Khan, the founder of the Yuan dynasty, favored Buddhism, especially the Tibetan variants. As a result, Tibetan Buddhism was established as the de facto state religion. The top-level department and government agency known as the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs (Xuanzheng Yuan) was set up in Khanbaliq (modern Beijing) to supervise Buddhist monks throughout the empire. Since Kublai Khan only esteemed the Sakya sect of Tibetan Buddhism, other religions became less important. He and his successors kept a Sakya Imperial Preceptor (Dishi) at court. Before the end of the Yuan dynasty, 14 leaders of the Sakya sect had held the post of Imperial Preceptor, thereby enjoying special power.

It originates from medicine and early studies on the causes of immunity to disease. The earliest known reference to immunity was during the plague of Athens in 430 BC. Thucydides noted that people who had recovered from a previous bout of the disease could nurse the sick without contracting the illness a second time. In the 18th century, Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis made experiments with scorpion venom and observed that certain dogs and mice were immune to this venom. This and other observations of acquired immunity were later exploited by Louis Pasteur in his development of vaccination and his proposed germ theory of disease. Pasteur's theory was in direct opposition to contemporary theories of disease, such as the miasma theory. It was not until Robert Koch's 1891 proofs, for which he was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1905, that microorganisms were confirmed as the cause of infectious disease. Viruses were confirmed as human pathogens in 1901, with the discovery of the yellow fever virus by Walter Reed."},{"qas":[{"question":"What type of immune systems are found in all plants and animals?","id":"baba7bf8b0dde57c2cbeafe6b","answers":[{"text":"Innate immune systems","answer_start":325},{"text":"Innate","answer_start":325},{"text":"Innate immune systems","answer_start":325}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What immune system is activated by the innate response?","id":"1f43e2bfb72cefcad8f32f488","answers":[{"text":"adaptive immune system","answer_start":491},{"text":"adaptive","answer_start":491},{"text":"the adaptive immune system","answer_start":487}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What allows the adaptive immune system to react faster and more strongly each subsequent time a pathogen is encountered?","id":"466b9f0efed0af56adb1be3df","answers":[{"text":"immunological memory","answer_start":764},{"text":"immunological memory","answer_start":764},{"text":"immunological memory","answer_start":764}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the first line of defense against pathogens that prevents them from entering an organism?","id":"b7dbfaefa6ecf5fde555946ad","answers":[{"text":"physical barriers","answer_start":118},{"text":"physical barriers","answer_start":118},{"text":"physical barriers","answer_start":118}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"immune system","answer_start":4}],"question":"What exposes organisms to infection?","id":"1d4811bb5ffab00a5fc0e30bb","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"pathogens","answer_start":144}],"question":"What is not prevented from entering an organism?","id":"75da05aa6141b093edb6cf9ce","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"adaptive immune system","answer_start":491}],"question":"What is activated before the innate response in vertebrates?","id":"72fd63e2ccedab9c42ef7a52e","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"improved response","answer_start":671}],"question":"What is gotten rid of after a pathogen has been eliminated?","id":"5ee4954eb7b4cf5b652eb5c7c","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"immunological memory","answer_start":764}],"question":"What causes the organism to attack more slowly and weakly every time a pathogen is encountered?","id":"0cea0c4a10cc9ddbeee7e2afa","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"The immune system protects organisms from infection with layered defenses of increasing specificity.

Phagocytes generally patrol the body searching for pathogens, but can be called to specific locations by cytokines. Once a pathogen has been engulfed by a phagocyte, it becomes trapped in an intracellular vesicle called a phagosome, which subsequently fuses with another vesicle called a lysosome to form a phagolysosome. The pathogen is killed by the activity of digestive enzymes or following a respiratory burst that releases free radicals into the phagolysosome. Phagocytosis evolved as a means of acquiring nutrients, but this role was extended in phagocytes to include engulfment of pathogens as a defense mechanism. Phagocytosis probably represents the oldest form of host defense, as phagocytes have been identified in both vertebrate and invertebrate animals."},{"qas":[{"question":"What are two types of phagocytes that travel through the body to find invading pathogens?","id":"6cf29a9f6ddccdcfdf1d11a5b","answers":[{"text":"Neutrophils and macrophages","answer_start":0},{"text":"Neutrophils and macrophages","answer_start":0},{"text":"Neutrophils and macrophages","answer_start":0}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What are the most abundant kind of phagocyte?","id":"d2efd12c3cd3db9b52e8e1cdc","answers":[{"text":"Neutrophils","answer_start":109},{"text":"Neutrophils","answer_start":109},{"text":"Neutrophils","answer_start":109}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What percentage of leukocytes do neutrophils represent?","id":"174f19eaeff3fd9b39f3af3ba","answers":[{"text":"50% to 60%","answer_start":226},{"text":"50% to 60%","answer_start":226},{"text":"50% to 60%","answer_start":226}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the process in which neutrophils move towards the site of inflammation called?","id":"4511c598db0adadc50ab33a8e","answers":[{"text":"chemotaxis","answer_start":435},{"text":"chemotaxis","answer_start":435},{"text":"chemotaxis","answer_start":435}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is a regulatory factor produced by macrophages?","id":"9e0dd9b8e4ca7bb9bbf53bfdf","answers":[{"text":"interleukin 1","answer_start":684},{"text":"interleukin 1","answer_start":684},{"text":"interleukin 1","answer_start":684}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Neutrophils and macrophages","answer_start":0}],"question":"What are pathogens that travel through the body looking for phagocytes called?","id":"eaf8abcf33e566caeac724dad","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"bloodstream","answer_start":147}],"question":"Where are neutrophils rarely found?","id":"ca2167ad8e027dd290de4d1e7","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Neutrophils","answer_start":109}],"question":"What is the least abundant type of phagocyte?","id":"414cb2aece1e82cdccc8e099e","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"neutrophils","answer_start":363}],"question":"What are usually the last cells to arrive at the scene of an infection?","id":"5c3afbc674baaad9da8546beb","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Macrophages","answer_start":699}],"question":"What cell is unable to act as a scavenger?","id":"e1c7efd1ddababbcffcec6a5f","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Neutrophils and macrophages are phagocytes that travel throughout the body in pursuit of invading pathogens.

As with B cells, each type of T cell recognizes a different antigen. Killer T cells are activated when their T cell receptor (TCR) binds to this specific antigen in a complex with the MHC Class I receptor of another cell. Recognition of this MHC:antigen complex is aided by a co-receptor on the T cell, called CD8. The T cell then travels throughout the body in search of cells where the MHC I receptors bear this antigen. When an activated T cell contacts such cells, it releases cytotoxins, such as perforin, which form pores in the target cell's plasma membrane, allowing ions, water and toxins to enter. The entry of another toxin called granulysin (a protease) induces the target cell to undergo apoptosis. T cell killing of host cells is particularly important in preventing the replication of viruses.

The MHC:antigen complex is also recognized by the helper cell's CD4 co-receptor, which recruits molecules inside the T cell (e.g., Lck) that are responsible for the T cell's activation. Helper T cells have a weaker association with the MHC:antigen complex than observed for killer T cells, meaning many receptors (around 200\u2013300) on the helper T cell must be bound by an MHC:antigen in order to activate the helper cell, while killer T cells can be activated by engagement of a single MHC:antigen molecule. Helper T cell activation also requires longer duration of engagement with an antigen-presenting cell. The activation of a resting helper T cell causes it to release cytokines that influence the activity of many cell types. Cytokine signals produced by helper T cells enhance the microbicidal function of macrophages and the activity of killer T cells. In addition, helper T cell activation causes an upregulation of molecules expressed on the T cell's surface, such as CD40 ligand (also called CD154), which provide extra stimulatory signals typically required to activate antibody-producing B cells."},{"qas":[{"question":"Gamma delta T cells share the characteristics of what other types of T cells?","id":"eb7fc2fa24cf4c3ded5face6e","answers":[{"text":"helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells and NK cells","answer_start":152},{"text":"helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells","answer_start":152},{"text":"helper T cells","answer_start":152}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Gamma delta T cells have a different version of what receptor?","id":"b40a58ede11cceee10434e3db","answers":[{"text":"alternative T cell receptor (TCR)","answer_start":44},{"text":"T cell","answer_start":56},{"text":"T cell receptor (TCR)","answer_start":56}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What type of T cells help with both innnate and adaptive immunity?","id":"c2cd9c1da9bf06c46fa5b56df","answers":[{"text":"\u03b3\u03b4 T cells","answer_start":395},{"text":"\u03b3\u03b4","answer_start":395},{"text":"\u03b3\u03b4 T cells","answer_start":395}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Gamma delta T cells rearrange TCR genes to produce what?","id":"f42cbf0ed991ea0aabbd77f3a","answers":[{"text":"receptor diversity","answer_start":564},{"text":"receptor diversity","answer_start":564},{"text":"receptor diversity","answer_start":564}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What kind of human T cells respond to common molecules produced by microbes?","id":"2b6209ed6555ea3ae3cd4e0c7","answers":[{"text":"V\u03b39\/V\u03b42 T cells","answer_start":822},{"text":"V\u03b39\/V\u03b42","answer_start":822},{"text":"V\u03b39\/V\u03b42 T cells","answer_start":822}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Gamma delta T cells","answer_start":0}],"question":"What cells do not possess an alternative T cell receptor?","id":"f7e2be2d5bb0fbecbbfd57df6","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells and NK cells","answer_start":152}],"question":"What cells do gamma delta T cells not share characteristics with?","id":"f016ace916f8e3a6d49c35f5f","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"conditions that produce responses","answer_start":204}],"question":"What is fully understood about \u03b3\u03b4 T cells?","id":"3ab2a6252daf2fd19dcc8ddc7","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"human V\u03b39\/V\u03b42 T cells","answer_start":816}],"question":"What responds in small numbers to common molecules produced by microbes?","id":"ea75d8c802795ff28aeff5902","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Gamma delta T cells (\u03b3\u03b4 T cells) possess an alternative T cell receptor (TCR) as opposed to CD4+ and CD8+ (\u03b1\u03b2) T cells and share the characteristics of helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells and NK cells.

Inflammation causes a great deal of oxidative stress and the presence of melatonin during sleep times could actively counteract free radical production during this time."},{"qas":[{"question":"What does a T cell extend when it encounters a foreign pathogen?","id":"08fde76964a1f48e810a30aec","answers":[{"text":"a vitamin D receptor","answer_start":56},{"text":"extends a vitamin D receptor","answer_start":48},{"text":"vitamin D receptor","answer_start":58}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the active form of vitamin D known as?","id":"d19c4ced0ee2fd8e8db222ee4","answers":[{"text":"calcitriol","answer_start":201},{"text":"calcitriol","answer_start":201},{"text":"steroid hormone calcitriol","answer_start":185}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the nature of the relationship between T-cells and vitamin D?","id":"57cac5280ea7e7ff45e473afa","answers":[{"text":"symbiotic relationship","answer_start":228},{"text":"symbiotic","answer_start":228},{"text":"symbiotic relationship","answer_start":228}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What gene is responsible for converting calcidiol into calcitriol?","id":"64acfaf4cd8cb4ab81e630ada","answers":[{"text":"gene CYP27B1","answer_start":433},{"text":"CYP27B1","answer_start":438},{"text":"gene CYP27B1","answer_start":433}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Other than T cells, what other immune cells express CYP27B1?","id":"40b9b834c7c49cc2a064edb7c","answers":[{"text":"dendritic cells, keratinocytes and macrophages","answer_start":767},{"text":"dendritic cells, keratinocytes and macrophages","answer_start":767},{"text":"dendritic cells","answer_start":767}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"extends a vitamin D receptor","answer_start":48}],"question":"What does a pathogen do when it encounters a T-cell?","id":"667fe4ecd4ece0fefb5affce7","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"T-cell","answer_start":133}],"question":"What cell binds to vitamin C?","id":"7ba9fc5e972d7e2de98eafbfc","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"vitamin D","answer_start":256}],"question":"What vitamin do T-cells have a parasitic relationship with?","id":"32c458ee2be0f27e789cad52d","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"CYP27B1","answer_start":438}],"question":"What gene is expressed by the B-cell?","id":"cea70dda05d0ecbfbbfa37edc","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"CYP27B1","answer_start":438}],"question":"What gene converts calcitriol into calcidiol?","id":"b6323e0b6b7975102bbca7efc","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"When a T-cell encounters a foreign pathogen, it extends a vitamin D receptor.

Type I hypersensitivity is mediated by IgE, which triggers degranulation of mast cells and basophils when cross-linked by antigen. Type II hypersensitivity occurs when antibodies bind to antigens on the patient's own cells, marking them for destruction. This is also called antibody-dependent (or cytotoxic) hypersensitivity, and is mediated by IgG and IgM antibodies. Immune complexes (aggregations of antigens, complement proteins, and IgG and IgM antibodies) deposited in various tissues trigger Type III hypersensitivity reactions. Type IV hypersensitivity (also known as cell-mediated or delayed type hypersensitivity) usually takes between two and three days to develop. Type IV reactions are involved in many autoimmune and infectious diseases, but may also involve contact dermatitis (poison ivy).

Some examples of intracellular pathogens include viruses, the food poisoning bacterium Salmonella and the eukaryotic parasites that cause malaria (Plasmodium falciparum) and leishmaniasis (Leishmania spp.). Other bacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, live inside a protective capsule that prevents lysis by complement. Many pathogens secrete compounds that diminish or misdirect the host's immune response. Some bacteria form biofilms to protect themselves from the cells and proteins of the immune system. Such biofilms are present in many successful infections, e.g., the chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cenocepacia infections characteristic of cystic fibrosis. Other bacteria generate surface proteins that bind to antibodies, rendering them ineffective; examples include Streptococcus (protein G), Staphylococcus aureus (protein A), and Peptostreptococcus magnus (protein L)."},{"qas":[{"question":"What is the process by which the adaptive immune system is evaded by the chainging of non-essential epitopes called?","id":"325df39e7b26e2eeb679f78c8","answers":[{"text":"antigenic variation","answer_start":263},{"text":"antigenic variation","answer_start":263},{"text":"antigenic variation","answer_start":263}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is an example of a virus that uses antigenic variation?","id":"edaab392e9d31db84c8aa4e3a","answers":[{"text":"HIV","answer_start":298},{"text":"HIV","answer_start":298},{"text":"HIV","answer_start":298}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is an example of a parasite that used the antigenic variation strategy to evade destruction?","id":"0f1ec85f1880e60be06ea1d1e","answers":[{"text":"Trypanosoma brucei","answer_start":553},{"text":"Trypanosoma brucei","answer_start":553},{"text":"Trypanosoma brucei","answer_start":553}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What compounds can be masked with the molecules of the host cell in order for a virus to evade detection?","id":"39d1d4da66e32af3eddcbbf6a","answers":[{"text":"antigens","answer_start":728},{"text":"antigens","answer_start":728},{"text":"antigens","answer_start":728}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"evade the adaptive immune system","answer_start":23}],"question":"What are the less complex mechanisms used to do?","id":"2b5c5c9ccbee4f121889a489d","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"rapidly change non-essential epitopes","answer_start":106}],"question":"What is the most complex way to avoid the adaptive immune system?","id":"2b20a7e3a7899e22700abfdd7","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"HIV","answer_start":298}],"question":"What is a pathogen that does not use antigenic variation?","id":"d1f05be9c6ebac6a78eebecf6","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"frequent changes in antigens","answer_start":450}],"question":"What does not explain the failure of vaccines directed at the HIV virus?","id":"ff2c7d3c9b67bec6b8cc388d8","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Trypanosoma brucei","answer_start":553}],"question":"What is a parasite that always uses the same surface protein?","id":"5d6049bf2fff778ec69b6312b","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"The mechanisms used to evade the adaptive immune system are more complicated. The simplest approach is to rapidly change non-essential epitopes (amino acids and\/or sugars) on the surface of the pathogen, while keeping essential epitopes concealed. This is called antigenic variation. An example is HIV, which mutates rapidly, so the proteins on its viral envelope that are essential for entry into its host target cell are constantly changing. These frequent changes in antigens may explain the failures of vaccines directed at this virus. The parasite Trypanosoma brucei uses a similar strategy, constantly switching one type of surface protein for another, allowing it to stay one step ahead of the antibody response. Masking antigens with host molecules is another common strategy for avoiding detection by the immune system. In HIV, the envelope that covers the virion is formed from the outermost membrane of the host cell; such \"self-cloaked\" viruses make it difficult for the immune system to identify them as \"non-self\" structures."},{"qas":[{"question":"What is the process by which the immune system identifies tumors called?","id":"37aa39d2fe680ecbcaab3abed","answers":[{"text":"immune surveillance","answer_start":96},{"text":"immune surveillance","answer_start":96},{"text":"immune surveillance","answer_start":96}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is the virus in humans that causes cervical cancer?","id":"bfbccada7c77beaddce465e4f","answers":[{"text":"human papillomavirus","answer_start":433},{"text":"human papillomavirus","answer_start":433},{"text":"human papillomavirus","answer_start":433}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is an example of an enzyme that can transform skin cells into tumors when expressed at high levels?","id":"2c7055ab6b04b0e0b3214aba2","answers":[{"text":"tyrosinase","answer_start":641},{"text":"tyrosinase","answer_start":641},{"text":"tyrosinase","answer_start":641}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What are cancerous tumors of the skin known as?","id":"9dbc679fb46ba6e0d67bdade9","answers":[{"text":"melanomas","answer_start":757},{"text":"melanomas","answer_start":757},{"text":"melanomas","answer_start":757}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What are the skin cells that can be transformed into tumors known as?","id":"eb910fab426a921ec03f73a97","answers":[{"text":"melanocytes","answer_start":725},{"text":"melanocytes","answer_start":725},{"text":"melanocytes","answer_start":725}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"identify and eliminate tumors","answer_start":50}],"question":"What is not an important role of the immune system?","id":"9fba9daabd5c13c7b8d4fb795","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"antigens","answer_start":157}],"question":"What do tumors express that are also found on normal cells?","id":"ccca3f7d4095bfdccfc7fa719","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"oncogenic viruses","answer_start":410}],"question":"What is not a cause of tumor antigens?","id":"f2d017bd463afb443afcf7fdb","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"transforms certain skin cells (e.g. melanocytes) into tumors","answer_start":689}],"question":"What happens when tyrosinase is expressed at low levels?","id":"a2dbdcb1cb7e8bf80cc6efeed","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"oncogenes","answer_start":942}],"question":"What is a fourth possible source for tumor antigens?","id":"15eef4ea2e9f9e7b30237eacb","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Another important role of the immune system is to identify and eliminate tumors.

Computational methods have been developed to predict the immunogenicity of peptides and proteins, which are particularly useful in designing therapeutic antibodies, assessing likely virulence of mutations in viral coat particles, and validation of proposed peptide-based drug treatments. Early techniques relied mainly on the observation that hydrophilic amino acids are overrepresented in epitope regions than hydrophobic amino acids; however, more recent developments rely on machine learning techniques using databases of existing known epitopes, usually on well-studied virus proteins, as a training set. A publicly accessible database has been established for the cataloguing of epitopes from pathogens known to be recognizable by B cells. The emerging field of bioinformatics-based studies of immunogenicity is referred to as immunoinformatics.

First, during the early slow-wave-sleep stage, a sudden drop in blood levels of cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine induce increased blood levels of the hormones leptin, pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin. These signals induce a pro-inflammatory state through the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1, interleukin-12, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma. These cytokines then stimulate immune functions such as immune cells activation, proliferation, and differentiation. It is during this time that undifferentiated, or less differentiated, like na\u00efve and central memory T cells, peak (i.e. during a time of a slowly evolving adaptive immune response). In addition to these effects, the milieu of hormones produced at this time (leptin, pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin) support the interactions between APCs and T-cells, a shift of the Th1\/Th2 cytokine balance towards one that supports Th1, an increase in overall Th cell proliferation, and na\u00efve T cell migration to lymph nodes.

Other basic immune mechanisms evolved in ancient eukaryotes and remain in their modern descendants, such as plants and invertebrates. These mechanisms include phagocytosis, antimicrobial peptides called defensins, and the complement system. Jawed vertebrates, including humans, have even more sophisticated defense mechanisms, including the ability to adapt over time to recognize specific pathogens more efficiently.

One of the principal objectives of the commission was to examine ways of enabling more self-government for Scotland, within the unitary state of the United Kingdom. Kilbrandon published his report in 1973 recommending the establishment of a directly elected Scottish Assembly to legislate for the majority of domestic Scottish affairs."},{"qas":[{"question":"Which sea was oil discovered in?","id":"b6aba9d2a090e7a6feadfebf5","answers":[{"text":"North","answer_start":46},{"text":"North Sea","answer_start":46},{"text":"the North Sea","answer_start":42}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What campaigh did the Scottish National Party (SNP) run?","id":"af2d5bc9e0e9dcafd2e58c63f","answers":[{"text":"\"It's Scotland's oil\"","answer_start":74},{"text":"It's Scotland's oil","answer_start":75},{"text":"\"It's Scotland's oil\"","answer_start":74}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What did the SNP publicly opine about the oil revenues?","id":"d25f48b6c83c92de4fbdbb5d2","answers":[{"text":"not benefitting Scotland as much as they should","answer_start":269},{"text":"not benefitting Scotland as much as they should","answer_start":269},{"text":"the revenues from the oil were not benefitting Scotland as much as they should","answer_start":238}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"When did Prime Minister Wilson commit to some form of devolved legislature?","id":"e28bcc8af6bdaa3cb2ca46a62","answers":[{"text":"1974","answer_start":449},{"text":"1974","answer_start":449},{"text":"1974","answer_start":449}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"When was the final legislative proposals for a Scottish Assembly passed?","id":"127dc681cb1f6d1fa36bf25bc","answers":[{"text":"1978","answer_start":481},{"text":"1978","answer_start":481},{"text":"1978","answer_start":481}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"rising support for Scottish independence","answer_start":154}],"question":"Discovery of gas in the North Sea resulted in what?","id":"8d29c207cbc67cd0431b4fade","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"some form of devolved legislature","answer_start":412}],"question":"President Wilson committed his government to what in 1974?","id":"ede2ea1c7771f5aec7c11fa8c","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"1978","answer_start":481}],"question":"Final proposals for a Scottish Assembly were passed by the United States Parliament in what year?","id":"bc9bace8e462e5af2fe2b4ddb","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"oil","answer_start":35}],"question":"The \"It's Scotland's oil\" campaign resulted from the discovery of what in the South Sea?","id":"996f06feefcedf38f014ecde4","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"During this time, the discovery of oil in the North Sea and the following \"It's Scotland's oil\" campaign of the Scottish National Party (SNP) resulted in rising support for Scottish independence, as well as the SNP.

The greatest distinction of an empire is through the amount of land that a nation has conquered and expanded. Political power grew from conquering land, however cultural and economic aspects flourished through sea and trade routes. A distinction about empires is \"that although political empires were built mostly by expansion overland, economic and cultural influences spread at least as much by sea\". Some of the main aspects of trade that went overseas consisted of animals and plant products. European empires in Asia and Africa \"have come to be seen as the classic forms of imperialism: and indeed most books on the subject confine themselves to the European seaborne empires\". European expansion caused the world to be divided by how developed and developing nation are portrayed through the world systems theory. The two main regions are the core and the periphery. The core consists of high areas of income and profit; the periphery is on the opposing side of the spectrum consisting of areas of low income and profit. These critical theories of Geo-politics have led to increased discussion of the meaning and impact of imperialism on the modern post-colonial world. The Russian leader Lenin suggested that \"imperialism was the highest form of capitalism, claiming that imperialism developed after colonialism, and was distinguished from colonialism by monopoly capitalism\". This idea from Lenin stresses how important new political world order has become in our modern era. Geopolitics now focuses on states becoming major economic players in the market; some states today are viewed as empires due to their political and economic authority over other nations."},{"qas":[{"question":"Imperialism is confused with what other term?","id":"e99eb5ff1c590a24fdbdd7e6c","answers":[{"text":"colonialism","answer_start":48},{"text":"colonialism","answer_start":48},{"text":"colonialism","answer_start":48},{"text":"colonialism","answer_start":48},{"text":"colonialism","answer_start":48}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What does colonialism lack that imperialism has?","id":"4fcbffbbbaf0adcc2e51df8e8","answers":[{"text":"political focus","answer_start":1222},{"text":"political focus","answer_start":1222},{"text":"political focus","answer_start":1222},{"text":"political focus","answer_start":1222},{"text":"ideological","answer_start":392}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Colonialism as a policy is caused by financial and what other reasons?","id":"b8170ba011d5aca68bfce5cd5","answers":[{"text":"ideological","answer_start":392},{"text":"ideological","answer_start":392},{"text":"ideological","answer_start":392},{"text":"commercial","answer_start":490}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who besides the Russians are often left out of the colonialism debat?","id":"73efefb2ab7d86ff8bcaeec4e","answers":[{"text":"Ottoman","answer_start":1003},{"text":"Ottoman","answer_start":1003},{"text":"Ottoman","answer_start":1003},{"text":"Ottoman","answer_start":1003},{"text":"Ottoman","answer_start":1003}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Imperialism and colonialism both assert a states dominance over what?","id":"12cbb54f6ce3babce2c2efeaf","answers":[{"text":"person or group of people","answer_start":257},{"text":"a person or group of people","answer_start":255},{"text":"a person or group of people","answer_start":255},{"text":"person or group of people","answer_start":257}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"colonialism","answer_start":48}],"question":"Imperialism is synonymous with what other term?","id":"1bdcbddae9d0445e47c84ff8d","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"political focus","answer_start":1222}],"question":" What does colonialism and imperialism share?","id":"a53d5823f30ec5da66f7d13ea","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"ideological","answer_start":392}],"question":"Colonialism as a policy is never caused by financial and what other reasons?","id":"ccad3f3492dce46efbd7ea9d8","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Ottoman","answer_start":1003}],"question":"Who besides the Russians are often included in the colonialism debat?","id":"eb047c0ee02ffecbcf0bbf3f2","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"person or group of people","answer_start":257}],"question":"Imperialism and colonialism don't assert a states dominance over what?","id":"1faf083cdcba9edb50480fe05","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"The term \"imperialism\" is often conflated with \"colonialism\", however many scholars have argued that each have their own distinct definition. Imperialism and colonialism have been used in order to describe one's superiority, domination and influence upon a person or group of people. Robert Young writes that while imperialism operates from the center, is a state policy and is developed for ideological as well as financial reasons, colonialism is simply the development for settlement or commercial intentions. Colonialism in modern usage also tends to imply a degree of geographic separation between the colony and the imperial power. Particularly, Edward Said distinguishes the difference between imperialism and colonialism by stating; \"imperialism involved 'the practice, the theory and the attitudes of a dominating metropolitan center ruling a distant territory', while colonialism refers to the 'implanting of settlements on a distant territory.' Contiguous land empires such as the Russian or Ottoman are generally excluded from discussions of colonialism.:116 Thus it can be said that imperialism includes some form of colonialism, but colonialism itself does not automatically imply imperialism, as it lacks a political focus.[further explanation needed]"},{"qas":[{"question":"Political advantage is an attribute of which state policies?","id":"3f1c0bcde80f0ed71e06dfeef","answers":[{"text":"Imperialism and colonialism","answer_start":0},{"text":"Imperialism and colonialism","answer_start":0},{"text":"Imperialism and colonialism","answer_start":0},{"text":"Imperialism and colonialism","answer_start":0}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Colonialism often means a country doing what?","id":"ea8d6cdc4ceae8d3cb9bcfdfb","answers":[{"text":"taking physical control of another","answer_start":347},{"text":"a conquest over an area","answer_start":700},{"text":"the process of a country taking physical control of another","answer_start":322},{"text":"dominating areas","answer_start":536},{"text":"country taking physical control of another","answer_start":339}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How would one create an empire by means of Imperialism?","id":"6b58603ab830cafff0cfd6ea4","answers":[{"text":"conquering the other state's lands","answer_start":1061},{"text":"conquering the other state's lands and therefore increasing its own dominance","answer_start":1061},{"text":"by conquering the other state's lands","answer_start":1058},{"text":"political and monetary dominance","answer_start":409}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"what do conquering people pass down to native populations?","id":"a11ad0183d963d554e887a16d","answers":[{"text":"characteristics","answer_start":1403},{"text":"characteristics of the conquering peoples","answer_start":1403},{"text":"characteristics of the conquering peoples","answer_start":1403},{"text":"the characteristics of the conquering peoples","answer_start":1399},{"text":"characteristics","answer_start":1403}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is colonialism's core meaning?","id":"9c2b976c3facfba0d0a3bacf9","answers":[{"text":"exploitation","answer_start":845},{"text":"the exploitation of the valuable assets and supplies","answer_start":841},{"text":"the exploitation of the valuable assets and supplies of the nation that was conquered","answer_start":841},{"text":"exploitation of the valuable assets and supplies of the nation that was conquered and the conquering nation then gaining the benefits","answer_start":845},{"text":"exploitation of the valuable assets and supplies of the nation that was conquered","answer_start":845}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"imperialism and colonialism","answer_start":231}],"question":"Political disadvantage is an attribute of which state policies?","id":"f59979121ec9eedacffefb3b5","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"taking physical control of another","answer_start":347}],"question":" Colonialism never means a country doing what?","id":"edb7dca28ba7fd84442e27d0d","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"conquering the other state's lands","answer_start":1061}],"question":" How would one create an empire by means of non-Imperialism?","id":"1844bd7394b0bb6208dde1711","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"characteristics","answer_start":1403}],"question":" what do conquering people take away from native populations?","id":"ecbdf7d78c63a9bd7e1bcb3d8","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"exploitation","answer_start":845}],"question":" What is colonialism's antithesis?","id":"736db1a3eb1f4c8942eaba85e","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Imperialism and colonialism both dictate the political and economic advantage over a land and the indigenous populations they control, yet scholars sometimes find it difficult to illustrate the difference between the two. Although imperialism and colonialism focus on the suppression of an other, if colonialism refers to the process of a country taking physical control of another, imperialism refers to the political and monetary dominance, either formally or informally. Colonialism is seen to be the architect deciding how to start dominating areas and then imperialism can be seen as creating the idea behind conquest cooperating with colonialism. Colonialism is when the imperial nation begins a conquest over an area and then eventually is able to rule over the areas the previous nation had controlled. Colonialism's core meaning is the exploitation of the valuable assets and supplies of the nation that was conquered and the conquering nation then gaining the benefits from the spoils of the war. The meaning of imperialism is to create an empire, by conquering the other state's lands and therefore increasing its own dominance. Colonialism is the builder and preserver of the colonial possessions in an area by a population coming from a foreign region. Colonialism can completely change the existing social structure, physical structure and economics of an area; it is not unusual that the characteristics of the conquering peoples are inherited by the conquered indigenous populations."},{"qas":[{"question":"what is the most controversial aspect of imperialism?","id":"9cca207b9fb745ec4c4cf01f7","answers":[{"text":"empire-building","answer_start":74},{"text":"defense and justification of empire-building","answer_start":45},{"text":"is the defense and justification of empire-building based on seemingly rational grounds","answer_start":38},{"text":"defense and justification of empire-building based on seemingly rational grounds","answer_start":45},{"text":"defense and justification of empire-building","answer_start":45}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":" J.

This difference was particularly apparent in textual and visual works of early European studies of the Orient that positioned the East as irrational and backward in opposition to the rational and progressive West. Defining the East as a negative vision of itself, as its inferior, not only increased the West\u2019s sense of self, but also was a way of ordering the East and making it known to the West so that it could be dominated and controlled. The discourse of Orientalism therefore served as an ideological justification of early Western imperialism, as it formed a body of knowledge and ideas that rationalized social, cultural, political, and economic control of other territories."},{"qas":[{"question":"bassett focuses on what to illustrate his idea?","id":"c98a8eeeabacfed7e76eed7ca","answers":[{"text":"nineteenth-century maps","answer_start":76},{"text":"nineteenth-century maps","answer_start":76},{"text":"the role of nineteenth-century maps","answer_start":64},{"text":"the role of nineteenth-century maps","answer_start":64},{"text":"the role of nineteenth-century maps during the \"scramble for Africa\"","answer_start":64}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What provided an incentive to western empires to colonize Africa?","id":"3f37a6daa620fbee9d1cb2473","answers":[{"text":"blank spaces on contemporary maps","answer_start":519},{"text":"fill in blank spaces on contemporary maps","answer_start":511},{"text":"maps","answer_start":149},{"text":"maps","answer_start":149},{"text":"blank space","answer_start":372}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What were blank spaces used for on nineteenth-century maps?","id":"475bd3b8acb63dbafb82c01ed","answers":[{"text":"unexplored territory","answer_start":405},{"text":"unknown or unexplored territory","answer_start":394},{"text":"unknown or unexplored territory","answer_start":394},{"text":"to denote unknown or unexplored territory","answer_start":384},{"text":"unknown or unexplored territory","answer_start":394}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What did Basset analyze before coming to his conclusions?","id":"aa25b2b1ebeae712c8d754cd1","answers":[{"text":"nineteenth-century cartographic techniques","answer_start":303},{"text":"nineteenth-century maps","answer_start":76},{"text":"nineteenth-century cartographic techniques","answer_start":303},{"text":"nineteenth-century maps","answer_start":76},{"text":"role of nineteenth-century maps","answer_start":68}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who besides the british colonized Africa?","id":"e3dffb6dd7c4d8a9e4ffd0cb1","answers":[{"text":"French","answer_start":236},{"text":"French","answer_start":236},{"text":"French","answer_start":236},{"text":"French","answer_start":236},{"text":"French","answer_start":236}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"nineteenth-century maps","answer_start":76}],"question":" bassett doesn't focus on what to illustrate his idea?","id":"4bfb11bb1dae9aa5ef64ad903","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"blank space to denote unknown or unexplored territory","answer_start":372}],"question":" What provided an incentive to eastern empires to colonize Africa?","id":"abded84a650f5aa8bc28a6987","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"unexplored territory","answer_start":405}],"question":" What did Basset analyze after coming to his conclusions?","id":"d8e0daf36dcd1b91e1621e5dd","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"French","answer_start":236}],"question":" Who besides the british colonized Asia?","id":"5ac7ddefb371365b5d7e4afc4","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"To better illustrate this idea, Bassett focuses his analysis of the role of nineteenth-century maps during the \"scramble for Africa\".

This technology gave European armies an advantage over their opponents, as armies in less-developed countries were still fighting with arrows, swords, and leather shields (e.g. the Zulus in Southern Africa during the Anglo-Zulu War of 1879)."},{"qas":[{"question":"Theories on imperialism use which country as a model?","id":"5f6bc0eca4950ed58bc2dbfc5","answers":[{"text":"British","answer_start":84},{"text":"British","answer_start":84},{"text":"British","answer_start":84},{"text":"British","answer_start":84}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"When did the term imperialism first come to be used by its current definition?","id":"207a39fdcb14f84e95bbca037","answers":[{"text":"in the late 1870s","answer_start":187},{"text":"1870s","answer_start":199},{"text":"1870s","answer_start":199},{"text":"late 1870s","answer_start":194},{"text":"1870s","answer_start":199}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What was the idealized value of imperialism?","id":"5a4bb15c01bb63de8dc4bdc10","answers":[{"text":"philanthropy","answer_start":471},{"text":"idealism and philanthropy","answer_start":458},{"text":"philanthropy","answer_start":471},{"text":"idealism and philanthropy","answer_start":458}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"According to Lenin why must capitalistic countries have an imperialistic policy?","id":"baf4efff7ff8a5fa3ef6afaeb","answers":[{"text":"to constantly expand investment","answer_start":1009},{"text":"to constantly expand investment","answer_start":1009},{"text":"to constantly expand investment, material resources and manpower","answer_start":1009},{"text":"need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment, material resources and manpower","answer_start":979},{"text":"need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment, material resources and manpower in such a way that necessitated colonial expansion.","answer_start":979}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"British","answer_start":84}],"question":"Theories on imperialism don't use which country as a model?","id":"40dcd55cfbdc5acaad5ce7f83","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"1870s","answer_start":199}],"question":" When didn't the term imperialism first come to be used by its current definition?","id":"b5a541ca06c1f446dd1de3ca9","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"philanthropy","answer_start":471}],"question":" What wasn't the idealized value of imperialism?","id":"76dfeab4c1cd40d6e0d80a26a","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"constantly expand investment","answer_start":1012}],"question":" According to Lenin why must capitalistic countries not have an imperialistic policy?","id":"a1abcde969f26c93cfdbeb7dc","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Crusades","answer_start":1647}],"question":" When is the latest most Marxists claim imperialism as an extension of capitalism has its roots","id":"4e4dafb2e17eefbccfaa50d5a","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"In anglophone academic works, theories regarding imperialism are often based on the British experience. The term \"Imperialism\" was originally introduced into English in its present sense in the late 1870s by opponents of the allegedly aggressive and ostentatious imperial policies of British prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. It was shortly appropriated by supporters of \"imperialism\" such as Joseph Chamberlain. For some, imperialism designated a policy of idealism and philanthropy; others alleged that it was characterized by political self-interest, and a growing number associated it with capitalist greed. Liberal John A. Hobson and Marxist Vladimir Lenin added a more theoretical macroeconomic connotation to the term. Lenin in particular exerted substantial influence over later Marxist conceptions of imperialism with his work Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism. In his writings Lenin portrayed Imperialism as a natural extension of capitalism that arose from need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment, material resources and manpower in such a way that necessitated colonial expansion. This conception of imperialism as a structural feature of capitalism is echoed by later Marxist theoreticians. Many theoreticians on the left have followed in emphasizing the structural or systemic character of \"imperialism\". Such writers have expanded the time period associated with the term so that it now designates neither a policy, nor a short space of decades in the late 19th century, but a world system extending over a period of centuries, often going back to Christopher Columbus and, in some accounts, to the Crusades. As the application of the term has expanded, its meaning has shifted along five distinct but often parallel axes: the moral, the economic, the systemic, the cultural, and the temporal. Those changes reflect - among other shifts in sensibility - a growing unease, even squeamishness, with the fact of power, specifically, Western power."},{"qas":[{"question":"some debate that there is a correlation between capitalism, imperialism, and what?","id":"c9d8aaf6ea24a609c04adf2ea","answers":[{"text":"aristocracy","answer_start":36},{"text":"aristocracy","answer_start":36},{"text":"aristocracy","answer_start":36},{"text":"aristocracy","answer_start":36},{"text":"aristocracy","answer_start":36}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"When were Joseph Schumpeter and Norman Angell at their most prolific writing period?","id":"f5aab64a6abb43bdb823f6bb4","answers":[{"text":"before World War I","answer_start":361},{"text":"World War I","answer_start":368},{"text":"before World War I","answer_start":361},{"text":"before World War I","answer_start":361},{"text":"before World War I,","answer_start":361}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"When was the military-political complex reflected upon within the scope of understanding imperialism?","id":"419bcd498760fbbbd8b92776f","answers":[{"text":"the 1950s","answer_start":616},{"text":"1950s","answer_start":620},{"text":"1950s","answer_start":620},{"text":"1950s","answer_start":620},{"text":"1950s","answer_start":620}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Hobson argued that imperialism was an international what?","id":"8a62ffbc1c37b4de909ee6ad4","answers":[{"text":"disease","answer_start":699},{"text":"disease","answer_start":699},{"text":"disease","answer_start":699},{"text":"disease","answer_start":699},{"text":"disease","answer_start":699}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How did Hobson argue to rid the world of imperialism?","id":"24f78eac329bd80a9c7f4e12c","answers":[{"text":"taxation","answer_start":808},{"text":"removing its economic foundation","answer_start":725},{"text":"domestic social reforms","answer_start":646},{"text":"removing its economic foundation","answer_start":725},{"text":"removing its economic foundation.","answer_start":725}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"aristocracy","answer_start":36}],"question":"There is some debate that there is a not correlation between capitalism, imperialism, and what?","id":"3f12ef9ebcdd6cc6cbff91cf0","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"before World War I,","answer_start":361}],"question":" When weren't Joseph Schumpeter and Norman Angell at their most prolific writing period?","id":"b8ec34fe9f1fc4aad41ceb631","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"1950s","answer_start":620}],"question":" When was the military-political complex reflected upon not within the scope of understanding imperialism?","id":"daba4331be41aefc6b89ee46c","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"disease","answer_start":699}],"question":" Hobson argued that imperialism wasn't an international what?","id":"ef415cb6b45eed6bff9f2ffca","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"taxation","answer_start":808}],"question":" How did Hobson argue to not rid the world of imperialism?","id":"ae22bdbb5d3c21bdd56d44838","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"The correlation between capitalism, aristocracy, and imperialism has long been debated among historians and political theorists.

While these non-Marxist writers were at their most prolific before World War I, they remained active in the interwar years. Their combined work informed the study of imperialism and it's impact on Europe, as well as contributed to reflections on the rise of the military-political complex in the United States from the 1950s. Hobson argued that domestic social reforms could cure the international disease of imperialism by removing its economic foundation. Hobson theorized that state intervention through taxation could boost broader consumption, create wealth, and encourage a peaceful, tolerant, multipolar world order."},{"qas":[{"question":"What served as a justification for imposing imperialistic policies on certain peoples or regions?","id":"bcfe4c9fdffabefcc58b2ab10","answers":[{"text":"environmental determinism","answer_start":12},{"text":"environmental determinism","answer_start":12},{"text":"environmental determinism","answer_start":12},{"text":"environmental determinism","answer_start":12},{"text":"environmental determinism","answer_start":12}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What was thought to decide a person's behavior?","id":"f84243f979cbd3ddfac1e5c0a","answers":[{"text":"the environment in which they lived","answer_start":191},{"text":"environment in which they lived","answer_start":195},{"text":"environment","answer_start":195},{"text":"the environment in which they lived","answer_start":191},{"text":"environment","answer_start":195}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Humans in tropical environments were considered what?","id":"aafecf9ce9e05c6fb2f7ec325","answers":[{"text":"less civilized","answer_start":330},{"text":"less civilized","answer_start":330},{"text":"less civilized","answer_start":330},{"text":"less civilized","answer_start":330},{"text":"less civilized","answer_start":330}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Europe first colonized the Americas, then Asia, but what continent was third?","id":"05d01cf064993d06cd91f5f22","answers":[{"text":"Africa","answer_start":509},{"text":"Africa","answer_start":509},{"text":"Africa","answer_start":509},{"text":"Africa","answer_start":509},{"text":"Africa","answer_start":509}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What were the two forms of environmental determinism?","id":"dade6581edcfb6cfcffd0dc4c","answers":[{"text":"orientalism and tropicality","answer_start":639},{"text":"orientalism and tropicality","answer_start":639},{"text":"orientalism and tropicality","answer_start":639},{"text":"orientalism and tropicality","answer_start":639},{"text":"orientalism and tropicality.","answer_start":639}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"environmental determinism","answer_start":12}],"question":"What did not serve as a justification for imposing imperialistic policies on certain peoples or regions?","id":"b3a72c4edde8bfaaad21dede7","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"the environment in which they lived","answer_start":191}],"question":" What was not thought to decide a person's behavior?","id":"54a1bddfaf26dcbf17e2edca7","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"less civilized","answer_start":330}],"question":" Humans in tropical environments were not considered what?","id":"f6baa28fdd6dc53268e6f2acb","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Africa","answer_start":509}],"question":" Europe first colonized the Americas, then Asia, but what continent was fourth?","id":"4ea37f1e6dddafc6d0ca0ac1e","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"orientalism and tropicality","answer_start":639}],"question":" What were the three forms of environmental determinism?","id":"592eb27afabdec764fe6077fd","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"The concept environmental determinism served as a moral justification for domination of certain territories and peoples.

Lenin wrote extensively on the matter and famously declared that Imperialism was the highest stage of capitalism. However, after Lenin's death, Joseph Stalin established 'socialism in one country' for the Soviet Union, creating the model for subsequent inward looking Stalinist states and purging the early Internationalist elements. The internationalist tendencies of the early revolution would be abandoned until they returned in the framework of a client state in competition with the Americans during the Cold War. With the beginning of the new era, the after Stalin period called the \"thaw\", in the late 1950s, the new political leader Nikita Khrushchev put even more pressure on the Soviet-American relations starting a new wave of anti-imperialist propaganda. In his speech on the UN conference in 1960, he announced the continuation of the war on imperialism, stating that soon the people of different countries will come together and overthrow their imperialist leaders. Although the Soviet Union declared itself anti-imperialist, critics argue that it exhibited tendencies common to historic empires. Some scholars hold that the Soviet Union was a hybrid entity containing elements common to both multinational empires and nation states. It has also been argued that the USSR practiced colonialism as did other imperial powers and was carrying on the old Russian tradition of expansion and control.

One year later, a war erupted in the Philippines causing business, labor and government leaders in the US to condemn America's occupation in the Philippines as they also denounced them for causing the deaths of many Filipinos. American foreign policy was denounced as a \"racket\" by Smedley Butler, an American general. He said, \"Looking back on it, I might have given Al Capone a few hints.

This internal form is distinct from informal U.S. imperialism in the form of political and financial hegemony. This internal form of imperialism is also distinct from the United States' formation of \"colonies\" abroad. Through the treatment of its indigenous peoples during westward expansion, the United States took on the form of an imperial power prior to any attempts at external imperialism. This internal form of empire has been referred to as \"internal colonialism\". Participation in the African slave trade and the subsequent treatment of its 12 to 15 million Africans is viewed by some to be a more modern extension of America's \"internal colonialism\". However, this internal colonialism faced resistance, as external colonialism did, but the anti-colonial presence was far less prominent due to the nearly complete dominance that the United States was able to assert over both indigenous peoples and African-Americans. In his lecture on April 16, 2003, Edward Said made a bold statement on modern imperialism in the United States, whom he described as using aggressive means of attack towards the contemporary Orient, \"due to their backward living, lack of democracy and the violation of women\u2019s rights.

After the Third Partition of Poland in 1795, Warsaw was incorporated into the Kingdom of Prussia. In 1806 during the Napoleonic Wars, the city became the official capital of the Grand Duchy of Warsaw, a puppet state of the First French Empire established by Napoleon Bonaparte. In accordance with the decisions of the Congress of Vienna, the Russian Empire annexed Warsaw in 1815 and it became part of the \"Congress Kingdom\". Only in 1918 did it regain independence from the foreign rule and emerge as a new capital of the independent Republic of Poland. The German invasion in 1939, the massacre of the Jewish population and deportations to concentration camps led to the uprising in the Warsaw ghetto in 1943 and to the major and devastating Warsaw Uprising between August and October 1944. Warsaw gained the title of the \"Phoenix City\" because it has survived many wars, conflicts and invasions throughout its long history. Most notably, the city required painstaking rebuilding after the extensive damage it suffered in World War II, which destroyed 85% of its buildings. On 9 November 1940, the city was awarded Poland's highest military decoration for heroism, the Virtuti Militari, during the Siege of Warsaw (1939)."},{"qas":[{"question":"What archdiocese is Warsaw the seat of?","id":"ebaba2d4fbc065c3aea65eb6b","answers":[{"text":"Roman Catholic","answer_start":26},{"text":"Roman Catholic","answer_start":26},{"text":"Roman Catholic","answer_start":26}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is another notable university in Warsaw after the University of Warsaw?","id":"144a7cdde4dca9ef6bbf748ef","answers":[{"text":"Polish Academy of Sciences","answer_start":159},{"text":"Polish Academy of Sciences","answer_start":159},{"text":"Polish Academy of Sciences","answer_start":159}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What was Warsaw's Old Town listed as in 1980?","id":"faeeb99c5a6aa7ca946c54de0","answers":[{"text":"a UNESCO World Heritage Site","answer_start":365},{"text":"UNESCO World Heritage Site","answer_start":367},{"text":"UNESCO World Heritage Site","answer_start":367}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"King Sigimund's Column is an example of what kind of attraction in Warsaw?","id":"0f041c8f13ac55e95615316d0","answers":[{"text":"architectural","answer_start":406},{"text":"architectural","answer_start":406},{"text":"architectural","answer_start":406}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is a quarter of Warsaw filled with?","id":"3dfe84e05d246bc17eac95e3b","answers":[{"text":"luxurious parks and royal gardens","answer_start":905},{"text":"luxurious parks and royal gardens","answer_start":905},{"text":"luxurious parks and royal gardens","answer_start":905}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Roman Catholic","answer_start":26}],"question":"What archdiocese is Market Square the seat of?","id":"c43d59beac466ffa4de6f6575","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"a UNESCO World Heritage Site","answer_start":365}],"question":"What was Warsaw's Market Square listed as in 1980?","id":"3230f84e6aaf3b2bfc6c90d18","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"luxurious parks and royal gardens","answer_start":905}],"question":"What is a quarter of UNESCO filled with?","id":"9c369bb27cebdad8a1efd1f5c","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Polish Academy of Sciences","answer_start":159}],"question":"What is another notable university in UNESCO after the University of Warsaw?","id":"c1bd4b50e0edca82afadfd51e","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"architectural","answer_start":704}],"question":"King Sigimund's Column is an example of what kind of attraction in UNESCO?","id":"5892d98bca884966dff91e0fd","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"The city is the seat of a Roman Catholic archdiocese (left bank of the Vistula) and diocese (right bank), and possesses various universities, most notably the Polish Academy of Sciences and the University of Warsaw, two opera houses, theatres, museums, libraries and monuments.

The Monument of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising is also situated here. The \u0141azienki Park covers the area of 76 ha. The unique character and history of the park is reflected in its landscape architecture (pavilions, sculptures, bridges, cascades, ponds) and vegetation (domestic and foreign species of trees and bushes). What makes this park different from other green spaces in Warsaw is the presence of peacocks and pheasants, which can be seen here walking around freely, and royal carps in the pond. The Wilan\u00f3w Palace Park, dates back to the second half of the 17th century. It covers the area of 43 ha. Its central French-styled area corresponds to the ancient, baroque forms of the palace.

In 1758 the Pennsylvania government successfully negotiated the Treaty of Easton, in which a number of tribes in the Ohio Country promised neutrality in exchange for land concessions and other considerations. Most of the other northern tribes sided with the French, their primary trading partner and supplier of arms. The Creek and Cherokee were subject to diplomatic efforts by both the French and British to gain either their support or neutrality in the conflict.

Nevertheless, the format of the congress and many specifics of the plan became the prototype for confederation during the War of Independence."},{"qas":[{"question":"Who went to Fort Dusquesne in June 1755?","id":"54ff3bfe527d5953c4f2e561b","answers":[{"text":"Braddock (with George Washington as one of his aides) led about 1,500 army troops","answer_start":0},{"text":"Braddock","answer_start":0},{"text":"Braddock (with George Washington","answer_start":0},{"text":"Braddock","answer_start":0},{"text":"Braddock","answer_start":0}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How much success did this expedition with Braddock find?","id":"ab0d4fbfed4dfe3f2ea31fdba","answers":[{"text":"The expedition was a disaster","answer_start":158},{"text":"disaster","answer_start":179},{"text":"was a disaster","answer_start":173},{"text":"disaster","answer_start":179},{"text":"The expedition was a disaster","answer_start":158}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How many casualties did British get?","id":"7facd0bacb5c0f1beee7c78cc","answers":[{"text":"Approximately 1,000 British soldiers were killed or injured.","answer_start":330},{"text":"Approximately 1,000","answer_start":330},{"text":"1,000 British soldiers","answer_start":344},{"text":"1,000","answer_start":344},{"text":"1,000 British soldiers","answer_start":344}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What future Revolutionary key figures participated in this attack?","id":"ff0ccee6a78b0cbceee67f058","answers":[{"text":"Washington and Thomas Gage","answer_start":530},{"text":"George Washington","answer_start":432},{"text":"Washington and Thomas Gage","answer_start":530},{"text":"Washington and Thomas Gage","answer_start":530},{"text":"George Washington","answer_start":432}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Braddock","answer_start":0}],"question":"Who went to Fort Dusquesne in June 1745?","id":"dda9a5fb7dacddb3eedad8ac1","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Braddock","answer_start":0}],"question":"Who went to Fort Dusquesne in July 1755?","id":"d7cdc282edfb6df5e8cd8dadc","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"The expedition was a disaster","answer_start":158}],"question":"How much success didn't this expedition with Braddock find?","id":"bbbcae960afd84f44d6caedb8","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Approximately 1,000","answer_start":330}],"question":"How many casualties didn't British get?","id":"5eca010ebdacddb8bb5ff1cbd","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Washington and Thomas Gage","answer_start":530}],"question":"What future Revolutionary key figures never participated in this attack?","id":"8c3c8c47f8acfdf04dfdb5d31","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Braddock (with George Washington as one of his aides) led about 1,500 army troops and provincial militia on an expedition in June 1755 to take Fort Duquesne.

His schemes to supply the colony inflated prices and were believed by Montcalm to line his pockets and those of his associates. A massive outbreak of smallpox among western tribes led many of them to stay away from trading in 1758. While many parties to the conflict blamed others (the Indians blamed the French for bringing \"bad medicine\" as well as denying them prizes at Fort William Henry), the disease was probably spread through the crowded conditions at William Henry after the battle.

France chose to cede the former, but was able to negotiate the retention of Saint Pierre and Miquelon, two small islands in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, along with fishing rights in the area. They viewed the economic value of the Caribbean islands' sugar cane to be greater and easier to defend than the furs from the continent. The contemporaneous French philosopher Voltaire referred to Canada disparagingly as nothing more than a few acres of snow. The British, for their part, were happy to take New France, as defence of their North American colonies would no longer be an issue and also because they already had ample places from which to obtain sugar. Spain, which traded Florida to Britain to regain Cuba, also gained Louisiana, including New Orleans, from France in compensation for its losses.

The Ohio Country was particularly vulnerable to legal and illegal settlement due to the construction of military roads to the area by Braddock and Forbes. Although the Spanish takeover of the Louisiana territory (which was not completed until 1769) had modest repercussions, the British takeover of Spanish Florida resulted in the westward migration of tribes that did not want to do business with the British, and a rise in tensions between the Choctaw and the Creek, historic enemies whose divisions the British at times exploited. The change of control in Florida also prompted most of its Spanish Catholic population to leave. Most went to Cuba, including the entire governmental records from St. Augustine, although some Christianized Yamasee were resettled to the coast of Mexico."}]},{"title":"Force","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"What concept did philosophers in antiquity use to study simple machines?","id":"629ec88cc2bdb0d655aca53eb","answers":[{"text":"force","answer_start":46},{"text":"force","answer_start":46},{"text":"the concept of force","answer_start":31},{"text":"the concept of force","answer_start":31},{"text":"force","answer_start":46},{"text":"force","answer_start":46}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What was the belief that maintaining motion required force?","id":"62d7ffd7cf2ff3a2adbf613da","answers":[{"text":"fundamental error","answer_start":387},{"text":"A fundamental error","answer_start":385},{"text":"A fundamental error","answer_start":385},{"text":"A fundamental error","answer_start":385},{"text":"A fundamental error","answer_start":385},{"text":"A fundamental error","answer_start":385}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who had mathmatical insite?","id":"22eafd2862a8b82ccf1f3b9ab","answers":[{"text":"Sir Isaac Newton","answer_start":654},{"text":"Sir Isaac Newton","answer_start":654},{"text":"Sir Isaac Newton","answer_start":654},{"text":"Sir Isaac Newton","answer_start":654},{"text":"Sir Isaac Newton","answer_start":654},{"text":"Sir Isaac Newton","answer_start":654}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How long did it take to improve on Sir Isaac Newton's laws of motion?","id":"cfd181cccdc42aeb88513cad1","answers":[{"text":"nearly three hundred years","answer_start":727},{"text":"nearly three hundred years","answer_start":727},{"text":"nearly three hundred years","answer_start":727},{"text":"nearly three hundred years","answer_start":727},{"text":"nearly three hundred years","answer_start":727},{"text":"three hundred years","answer_start":734}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who develped the theory of relativity?","id":"e4a69aa2addbde8720a514dc7","answers":[{"text":"Einstein","answer_start":782},{"text":"Einstein","answer_start":782},{"text":"Einstein","answer_start":782},{"text":"Einstein","answer_start":782},{"text":"Einstein","answer_start":782},{"text":"Einstein","answer_start":782}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Philosophers","answer_start":0}],"question":"Who used the concept of antiquity in the study of stationary and moving objects?","id":"f0203a87b23af593fdefc97ff","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"motion","answer_start":377}],"question":"Something that is considered a non fundamental error is the belief that a force is required to maintain what?","id":"faa81579194ebe05dcc84e73b","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Galileo Galilei and Sir Isaac Newton","answer_start":585}],"question":"Most of the previous understandings about motion and force were corrected by whom?","id":"b7fcb68dcdc6bac4627b0acf4","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"motion and force","answer_start":539}],"question":"Sir Galileo Galilei corrected the previous misunderstandings about what?","id":"b70b4b5a8c1ca65bb3faa46ce","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"Sir Isaac Newton","answer_start":654}],"question":"Who formulated the laws of motion that were not improved-on for nearly three thousand years?","id":"0eab5fd1da48b8148988d9e7b","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"Philosophers in antiquity used the concept of force in the study of stationary and moving objects and simple machines, but thinkers such as Aristotle and Archimedes retained fundamental errors in understanding force.

A fundamental error was the belief that a force is required to maintain motion, even at a constant velocity. Most of the previous misunderstandings about motion and force were eventually corrected by Galileo Galilei and Sir Isaac Newton. With his mathematical insight, Sir Isaac Newton formulated laws of motion that were not improved-on for nearly three hundred years.

Aristotle believed that motionless objects on Earth, those composed mostly of the elements earth and water, to be in their natural place on the ground and that they will stay that way if left alone. He distinguished between the innate tendency of objects to find their \"natural place\" (e.g., for heavy bodies to fall), which led to \"natural motion\", and unnatural or forced motion, which required continued application of a force. This theory, based on the everyday experience of how objects move, such as the constant application of a force needed to keep a cart moving, had conceptual trouble accounting for the behavior of projectiles, such as the flight of arrows. The place where the archer moves the projectile was at the start of the flight, and while the projectile sailed through the air, no discernible efficient cause acts on it. Aristotle was aware of this problem and proposed that the air displaced through the projectile's path carries the projectile to its target.

Specifically, in systems where objects are moving with different velocities, it is impossible to determine which object is \"in motion\" and which object is \"at rest\".

The rotational inertia of planet Earth is what fixes the constancy of the length of a day and the length of a year. Albert Einstein extended the principle of inertia further when he explained that reference frames subject to constant acceleration, such as those free-falling toward a gravitating object, were physically equivalent to inertial reference frames. This is why, for example, astronauts experience weightlessness when in free-fall orbit around the Earth, and why Newton's Laws of Motion are more easily discernible in such environments. If an astronaut places an object with mass in mid-air next to himself, it will remain stationary with respect to the astronaut due to its inertia. This is the same thing that would occur if the astronaut and the object were in intergalactic space with no net force of gravity acting on their shared reference frame.

Resolving force vectors into components of a set of basis vectors is often a more mathematically clean way to describe forces than using magnitudes and directions. This is because, for orthogonal components, the components of the vector sum are uniquely determined by the scalar addition of the components of the individual vectors. Orthogonal components are independent of each other because forces acting at ninety degrees to each other have no effect on the magnitude or direction of the other. Choosing a set of orthogonal basis vectors is often done by considering what set of basis vectors will make the mathematics most convenient. Choosing a basis vector that is in the same direction as one of the forces is desirable, since that force would then have only one non-zero component.

This was contrary to Aristotle's notion of a \"natural state\" of rest that objects with mass naturally approached. Simple experiments showed that Galileo's understanding of the equivalence of constant velocity and rest were correct. For example, if a mariner dropped a cannonball from the crow's nest of a ship moving at a constant velocity, Aristotelian physics would have the cannonball fall straight down while the ship moved beneath it. Thus, in an Aristotelian universe, the falling cannonball would land behind the foot of the mast of a moving ship. However, when this experiment is actually conducted, the cannonball always falls at the foot of the mast, as if the cannonball knows to travel with the ship despite being separated from it. Since there is no forward horizontal force being applied on the cannonball as it falls, the only conclusion left is that the cannonball continues to move with the same velocity as the boat as it falls.

This description applies to all forces arising from fundamental interactions. While sophisticated mathematical descriptions are needed to predict, in full detail, the accurate result of such interactions, there is a conceptually simple way to describe such interactions through the use of Feynman diagrams. In a Feynman diagram, each matter particle is represented as a straight line (see world line) traveling through time, which normally increases up or to the right in the diagram. Matter and anti-matter particles are identical except for their direction of propagation through the Feynman diagram. World lines of particles intersect at interaction vertices, and the Feynman diagram represents any force arising from an interaction as occurring at the vertex with an associated instantaneous change in the direction of the particle world lines.

For example, Isaac Newton unified the force responsible for objects falling at the surface of the Earth with the force responsible for the orbits of celestial mechanics in his universal theory of gravitation. Michael Faraday and James Clerk Maxwell demonstrated that electric and magnetic forces were unified through one consistent theory of electromagnetism. In the 20th century, the development of quantum mechanics led to a modern understanding that the first three fundamental forces (all except gravity) are manifestations of matter (fermions) interacting by exchanging virtual particles called gauge bosons. This standard model of particle physics posits a similarity between the forces and led scientists to predict the unification of the weak and electromagnetic forces in electroweak theory subsequently confirmed by observation. The complete formulation of the standard model predicts an as yet unobserved Higgs mechanism, but observations such as neutrino oscillations indicate that the standard model is incomplete. A Grand Unified Theory allowing for the combination of the electroweak interaction with the strong force is held out as a possibility with candidate theories such as supersymmetry proposed to accommodate some of the outstanding unsolved problems in physics. Physicists are still attempting to develop self-consistent unification models that would combine all four fundamental interactions into a theory of everything. Einstein tried and failed at this endeavor, but currently the most popular approach to answering this question is string theory.:212\u2013219"},{"qas":[{"question":"Who identified gravity as a force?","id":"4edd2dba537f5cd7a9cc81343","answers":[{"text":"Isaac Newton","answer_start":83},{"text":"Isaac Newton","answer_start":83},{"text":"Isaac Newton","answer_start":83},{"text":"Isaac Newton","answer_start":83}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Who came up with the concept that falling objects fell at the same speed regardless of weight?","id":"9ca6baaaf5cfac98d2c06de4f","answers":[{"text":"Galileo","answer_start":233},{"text":"Galileo","answer_start":233},{"text":"Galileo","answer_start":233},{"text":"Galileo","answer_start":233}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"How fast do objects fall on Earth?","id":"a194b8fbb0cf6c0b4d5a59040","answers":[{"text":"about 9.81 meters per second squared","answer_start":555},{"text":"about 9.81 meters per second squared","answer_start":555},{"text":"about 9.81 meters per second","answer_start":555},{"text":"9.81 meters per second","answer_start":561}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"Where was the measurment for the standard gravity on Earth taken?","id":"640ba494b8b2d4615aa54c657","answers":[{"text":"sea level","answer_start":624},{"text":"sea level","answer_start":624},{"text":"sea level","answer_start":624},{"text":"from sea level","answer_start":619}],"is_impossible":false},{"question":"What is an object's mass proportional to at the surface of the Earth?","id":"8a8be7f5151c804d962ccfd1d","answers":[{"text":"force of gravity","answer_start":746},{"text":"the force of gravity on an object","answer_start":742},{"text":"force of gravity","answer_start":746},{"text":"force of gravity","answer_start":746}],"is_impossible":false},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"gravity","answer_start":17}],"question":"Until the work of Galileo, what was not identified as a universal force?","id":"de9d0cfdce8ca6f85fbc47fb0","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"objects","answer_start":303}],"question":"Newton was instrumental in describing the characteristics of falling what?","id":"37c2f5692e8416a8ecf27daa5","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"acceleration due to gravity towards the surface of the Earth","answer_start":445}],"question":"What has a magnitude of about 8.81 meters per second squared?","id":"ca83c0afbd4cdce937fccbdaf","answers":[],"is_impossible":true},{"plausible_answers":[{"text":"gravity","answer_start":17}],"question":"What was identified as a universal force after the work of Galileo?","id":"e808ef76ca17ff35c7cfa3768","answers":[],"is_impossible":true}],"context":"What we now call gravity was not identified as a universal force until the work of Isaac Newton.

It is only when observing the motion in a global sense that the curvature of space-time can be observed and the force is inferred from the object's curved path.

For example, a basketball thrown from the ground moves in a parabola, as it is in a uniform gravitational field.

Such forces act perpendicular to the velocity vector associated with the motion of an object, and therefore do not change the speed of the object (magnitude of the velocity), but only the direction of the velocity vector. The unbalanced force that accelerates an object can be resolved into a component that is perpendicular to the path, and one that is tangential to the path.
