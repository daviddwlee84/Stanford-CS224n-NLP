More powerful extensions of the Fermat primality test, such as the Baillie-PSW, Miller-Rabin, and Solovay-Strassen tests, are guaranteed to fail at least some of the time when applied to a composite number."},{"qas":[{"question":"Of what form are Sophie Germain primes?","id":"62ecacda00692d70ac3c65517","answers":[]},{"question":"Of what form are Mersenne primes?","id":"16eb0b2abd92e47832da24baf","answers":[]},{"question":"What test is especially useful for numbers of the form 2p - 1?","id":"beda6cbda5d311baa72751db6","answers":[]},{"question":"What is the name of one type of prime where p+1 or p-1 takes a certain shape?","id":"8e86ccfaad6faaddbf60f34c4","answers":[]},{"question":"What is the name of another type of prime here p+1 or p-1 takes a certain shape?","id":"3d7a2f0fd4ebdcc4aa9d2533b","answers":[]},{"question":"Of what form are Sophie Germain tests?","id":"eaec32fa6d92bacdeecf93255","answers":[]},{"question":"Of what form are Mersenne tests?","id":"ebe9d9bc95fdaa195408c2428","answers":[]},{"question":"What test is especially useful for tests of the form 2p-1?","id":"79936a9d1b99ae2bb34074acf","answers":[]},{"question":"What is the name of one type of test where p+1 or p-1 takes a certain shape?","id":"7274a78b4beb345fbfc0b6c64","answers":[]},{"question":"What is the name of another type of test where p+1 or p-1 takes a certain shape?","id":"45bd3fab3f8663f9df8ad3243","answers":[]}],"context":"are prime.

Over a 200-year period, average predator populations during hypothetical outbreaks of 14- and 15-year cicadas would be up to 2% higher than during outbreaks of 13- and 17-year cicadas. Though small, this advantage appears to have been enough to drive natural selection in favour of a prime-numbered life-cycle for these insects."},{"qas":[{"question":"What does the word prime generally suggest?","id":"d5bedd0b34bcc2cebbb9c263d","answers":[]},{"question":"For a field F containing 0 and 1, what would be the prime field?","id":"e80ca4bf1cf49d6bf9b3d0007","answers":[]},{"question":"What does it mean for a knot to be considered indecomposable?","id":"aaddabbce33b0aabcda9ef8d7","answers":[]},{"question":"How can any knot be distinctively indicated?","id":"5c451df5dd9c1b1df1666a753","answers":[]},{"question":"What is an additional meaning intended when the word prime is used?","id":"cb5fb49c718c0fd4e79b7ca84","answers":[]},{"question":"What does the word component generally suggest?","id":"ed60b2ebeca313da5d6ec680d","answers":[]},{"question":"For a field F containing 0 and 1, what would be the prime knot field?","id":"accbbe9dcd873e65a3d4096bf","answers":[]},{"question":"What does it mean for a knot to be considered a p element?","id":"cbb6f3ebc666a3e0cee86f7a1","answers":[]},{"question":"How can any knot be a field of F?","id":"669bdcbb9e185ca2b9eecf270","answers":[]},{"question":"What is an additional meaning intended when the word component is used?","id":"ee472d6aa23343a13f0b7a719","answers":[]}],"context":"The concept of prime number is so important that it has been generalized in different ways in various branches of mathematics. Generally, \"prime\" indicates minimality or indecomposability, in an appropriate sense. For example, the prime field is the smallest subfield of a field F containing both 0 and 1. It is either Q or the finite field with p elements, whence the name. Often a second, additional meaning is intended by using the word prime, namely that any object can be, essentially uniquely, decomposed into its prime components. For example, in knot theory, a prime knot is a knot that is indecomposable in the sense that it cannot be written as the knot sum of two nontrivial knots. Any knot can be uniquely expressed as a connected sum of prime knots.

The function of the spiral thread is uncertain, but it may absorb stress when prey tries to escape, and thus prevent the collobast from being torn apart. In addition to colloblasts, members of the genus Haeckelia, which feed mainly on jellyfish, incorporate their victims' stinging nematocytes into their own tentacles \u2013 some cnidaria-eating nudibranchs similarly incorporate nematocytes into their bodies for defense.

Euplokamis' tentilla have three types of movement that are used in capturing prey: they may flick out very quickly (in 40 to 60 milliseconds); they can wriggle, which may lure prey by behaving like small planktonic worms; and they coil round prey. The unique flicking is an uncoiling movement powered by contraction of the striated muscle. The wriggling motion is produced by smooth muscles, but of a highly specialized type.

Detailed investigation of chum salmon, Oncorhynchus keta, showed that these fish digest ctenophores 20 times as fast as an equal weight of shrimps, and that ctenophores can provide a good diet if there are enough of them around. Beroids prey mainly on other ctenophores. Some jellyfish and turtles eat large quantities of ctenophores, and jellyfish may temporarily wipe out ctenophore populations. Since ctenophores and jellyfish often have large seasonal variations in population, most fish that prey on them are generalists, and may have a greater effect on populations than the specialist jelly-eaters.

Mnemiopsis is well equipped to invade new territories (although this was not predicted until after it so successfully colonized the Black Sea), as it can breed very rapidly and tolerate a wide range of water temperatures and salinities. The impact was increased by chronic overfishing, and by eutrophication that gave the entire ecosystem a short-term boost, causing the Mnemiopsis population to increase even faster than normal \u2013 and above all by the absence of efficient predators on these introduced ctenophores. Mnemiopsis populations in those areas were eventually brought under control by the accidental introduction of the Mnemiopsis-eating North American ctenophore Beroe ovata, and by a cooling of the local climate from 1991 to 1993, which significantly slowed the animal's metabolism.

A series of studies that looked at the presence and absence of members of gene families and signalling pathways (e.g., homeoboxes, nuclear receptors, the Wnt signaling pathway, and sodium channels) showed evidence congruent with the latter two scenarios, that ctenophores are either sister to Cnidaria, Placozoa and Bilateria or sister to all other animal phyla. Several more recent studies comparing complete sequenced genomes of ctenophores with other sequenced animal genomes have also supported ctenophores as the sister lineage to all other animals. This position would suggest that neural and muscle cell types were either lost in major animal lineages (e.g., Porifera) or that they evolved independently in the ctenophore lineage.

Richard Harbison's purely morphological analysis in 1985 concluded that the cydippids are not monophyletic, in other words do not contain all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor that was itself a cydippid. Instead he found that various cydippid families were more similar to members of other ctenophore orders than to other cydippids. He also suggested that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was either cydippid-like or beroid-like. A molecular phylogeny analysis in 2001, using 26 species, including 4 recently discovered ones, confirmed that the cydippids are not monophyletic and concluded that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was cydippid-like. It also found that the genetic differences between these species were very small \u2013 so small that the relationships between the Lobata, Cestida and Thalassocalycida remained uncertain. This suggests that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was relatively recent, and perhaps was lucky enough to survive the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event 65.5 million years ago while other lineages perished. When the analysis was broadened to include representatives of other phyla, it concluded that cnidarians are probably more closely related to bilaterians than either group is to ctenophores but that this diagnosis is uncertain."}]},{"title":"Jacksonville,_Florida","paragraphs":[{"qas":[{"question":"Which Florida city has the biggest population?","id":"afcfbaf44b7b5ca7a7cacecae","answers":[]},{"question":"What was the population Jacksonville city as of 2010?","id":"233c6002d2ea7fb153edadabd","answers":[]},{"question":"Based on population alone, what is Jacksonville's ranking in the United States?","id":"f73af7c0b7e768568fef68f45","answers":[]},{"question":"In which county does Jacksonville reside?","id":"c3ede37d0b433e5b532df391e","answers":[]},{"question":"What year did consolidation cause Jacksonville to become part of Duval County?","id":"d5d358d89dd4da11b48eaed7e","answers":[]},{"question":"Which Florida city has a smallest population?","id":"4a00e6dace9bd10bf0caa5264","answers":[]},{"question":"What County was Jacksonville the seat of prior to 1968?","id":"f7ac4bc7717ff5bcd71cbe073","answers":[]},{"question":"What year did Jacksonville consolidate with Davis County?","id":"349a2ed14cc5a1b2edbfa4a96","answers":[]},{"question":"What is the largest metropolitan area in Florida and the Southeast?","id":"f5922d151bacec42f70d3647d","answers":[]},{"question":"What city proper has a population of 1,345,596?","id":"66badf8af054bda021f8ae2aa","answers":[]}],"context":"Jacksonville is the largest city by population in the U.S. state of Florida, and the largest city by area in the contiguous United States.

In 1964 all 15 of Duval County's public high schools lost their accreditation. This added momentum to proposals for government reform.

Under the terms of the affiliation, the schools were required to have courses of study comparable to those at the university, to notify the university early of any contemplated faculty appointments or dismissals, to make no faculty appointment without the university's approval, and to send copies of examinations for suggestions. The University of Chicago agreed to confer a degree on any graduating senior from an affiliated school who made a grade of A for all four years, and on any other graduate who took twelve weeks additional study at the University of Chicago. A student or faculty member of an affiliated school was entitled to free tuition at the University of Chicago, and Chicago students were eligible to attend an affiliated school on the same terms and receive credit for their work. The University of Chicago also agreed to provide affiliated schools with books and scientific apparatus and supplies at cost; special instructors and lecturers without cost except travel expenses; and a copy of every book and journal published by the University of Chicago Press at no cost. The agreement provided that either party could terminate the affiliation on proper notice. Several University of Chicago professors disliked the program, as it involved uncompensated additional labor on their part, and they believed it cheapened the academic reputation of the university.

Often the place that did this was called an apothecary and several languages have this as the dominant term, though their practices are more akin to a modern pharmacy, in English the term apothecary would today be seen as outdated or only approproriate if herbal remedies were on offer to a large extent.

Muhammad ibn Zakar\u012bya R\u0101zi (Rhazes) (865\u2013915), for instance, acted to promote the medical uses of chemical compounds. Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (Abulcasis) (936\u20131013) pioneered the preparation of medicines by sublimation and distillation. His Liber servitoris is of particular interest, as it provides the reader with recipes and explains how to prepare the `simples\u2019 from which were compounded the complex drugs then generally used. Sabur Ibn Sahl (d 869), was, however, the first physician to initiate pharmacopoedia, describing a large variety of drugs and remedies for ailments. Al-Biruni (973\u20131050) wrote one of the most valuable Islamic works on pharmacology, entitled Kitab al-Saydalah (The Book of Drugs), in which he detailed the properties of drugs and outlined the role of pharmacy and the functions and duties of the pharmacist. Avicenna, too, described no less than 700 preparations, their properties, modes of action, and their indications. He devoted in fact a whole volume to simple drugs in The Canon of Medicine. Of great impact were also the works by al-Maridini of Baghdad and Cairo, and Ibn al-Wafid (1008\u20131074), both of which were printed in Latin more than fifty times, appearing as De Medicinis universalibus et particularibus by 'Mesue' the younger, and the Medicamentis simplicibus by 'Abenguefit'. Peter of Abano (1250\u20131316) translated and added a supplement to the work of al-Maridini under the title De Veneris. Al-Muwaffaq\u2019s contributions in the field are also pioneering. Living in the 10th century, he wrote The foundations of the true properties of Remedies, amongst others describing arsenious oxide, and being acquainted with silicic acid. He made clear distinction between sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate, and drew attention to the poisonous nature of copper compounds, especially copper vitriol, and also lead compounds. He also describes the distillation of sea-water for drinking.[verification needed]"},{"qas":[{"question":"How far does one pharmacy in Croatia date back to?","id":"3adcf6d3e72c82ffccabbf76a","answers":[]},{"question":"Where is the oldest pharmacy stated to be located?","id":"6031a4f963ccfbde88c37e4f1","answers":[]},{"question":"What is the medieval Esteve Pharmacy used as at present?","id":"f2d8fca9e27a7c60ab842bf0f","answers":[]},{"question":"What sorts of items are displayed in the Esteve Pharmacy museum?","id":"bae136fc3eba5b099c5f8fbdb","answers":[]},{"question":"In what year is the oldest pharmacy said to have been established?","id":"bfcbedb2bce53ee06fc6b35b7","answers":[]},{"question":"Where is the newest pharmacy stated to be located?","id":"5fd4fce5fcfbed6b6ead4ae9e","answers":[]},{"question":"What year is the oldest pharmacy said to have been lost?","id":"07dc8ad6d69d2645f2e5cd7a0","answers":[]},{"question":"What is the medieval Esteve Pharmacy no longer used as at present?","id":"fa2bc1d8afbbfe1c4879d3c8e","answers":[]},{"question":"What sorts of items are never displayed in the Esteve Pharmacy museum?","id":"b84e633cdcb37e9e87f6abe06","answers":[]}],"context":"In Europe there are old pharmacies still operating in Dubrovnik, Croatia, located inside the Franciscan monastery, opened in 1317; and in the Town Hall Square of Tallinn, Estonia, dating from at least 1422.

Although building construction projects typically include various common elements, such as design, financial, estimating and legal considerations, many projects of varying sizes reach undesirable end results, such as structural collapse, cost overruns, and\/or litigation. For this reason, those with experience in the field make detailed plans and maintain careful oversight during the project to ensure a positive outcome."},{"qas":[{"question":"Residential construction practices, technologies, and resources must conform to what?","id":"2b0d5f5f3beeb41eb3f420d26","answers":[]},{"question":"What generally dictates the construction materials used?","id":"a849dfb58a0040121319dd30d","answers":[]},{"question":"Residential construction can generate what is not carefully planned?","id":"9c44b637b8089bcafaaa73ba6","answers":[]},{"question":"Site conditions, local regulations, economies of scale and the availability of skilled tradespeople all affect what?","id":"17aef4ea7a6a90a5c696e396f","answers":[]},{"question":"What must local regulations conform to?","id":"a614ee411fa4fcc758f5a5685","answers":[]},{"question":"What do custom designed homes dictate in the area?","id":"f5fd13fbd1b41496bb6dac6af","answers":[]},{"question":"What are some conditions that make the availability of skilled tradespeople vary?","id":"afcaad022dd7cacacfab3aeae","answers":[]},{"question":"What effect do technologies and resources generate?","id":"c118c6cd5ee38ddfa3aecf6ae","answers":[]},{"question":"What needs to happen to prevent building authority regulations?","id":"bff8ee9cbd9fe4a6aeb20cb2d","answers":[]}],"context":"Residential construction practices, technologies, and resources must conform to local building authority regulations and codes of practice.

The design team is most commonly employed by (i.e. in contract with) the property owner. Under this system, once the design is completed by the design team, a number of construction companies or construction management companies may then be asked to make a bid for the work, either based directly on the design, or on the basis of drawings and a bill of quantities provided by a quantity surveyor.

Indeed, one of the first clues that the phlogiston theory was incorrect was that metals, too, gain weight in rusting (when they were supposedly losing phlogiston)."},{"qas":[{"question":"How is dioxygen most simply described?","id":"bece06e0ffb28ea3da314c02c","answers":[]},{"question":"What is the bond order of dioxygen molecules?","id":"f6beccabecfef9bffba8ffeaa","answers":[]},{"question":"What is a descriptive term for a low-to-high energy bond?","id":"cb3c22cbf923a170fe16eb9cf","answers":[]},{"question":"In dioxygen how are the two oxygen atoms bonded together?","id":"cdedf4f1b86b3a7c7eeda3c6d","answers":[]},{"question":"Of what does the covalent double bond result from ?","id":"babbcf267ee3558d88c54baa5","answers":[]},{"question":"How is the dioxygen covalent bond explained?","id":"defaa0fbf1fbdc03bc8d5fc9d","answers":[]},{"question":"What is covalent bond a result of?","id":"e3d3a0f6ec9f862470a24fffb","answers":[]},{"question":"What axis do the 2p orbitals overlap with?","id":"f0da4e4bbecae7c5eb43e9c3e","answers":[]},{"question":"How many pairs of 2p orbitals lie along the O-O axis?","id":"c158f25ce4ed71ac84b2ec2fa","answers":[]}],"context":"In this dioxygen, the two oxygen atoms are chemically bonded to each other.

The measurement is technically difficult owing to the low signal-to-noise ratio and the physical structure of vegetation; but it has been proposed as a possible method of monitoring the carbon cycle from satellites on a global scale."},{"qas":[{"question":"What magnetic character do triplet O2 have?","id":"5a50aa4a9ecb6d70c4e5af465","answers":[]},{"question":"In experiments, a bridge of what element can be built between poles of a magnet?","id":"f45b18febeae678f8bd374abe","answers":[]},{"question":"The spin of what can produce a magnetic effect to oxygen molecules?","id":"e8f8ddcfbfdeb29feaff8f7b5","answers":[]},{"question":"What kind of field is necessary to produce a magnet effect in oxygen molecules?","id":"8f4fbc7ada02b2dab1dc0fbf0","answers":[]},{"question":"What device is used to test the magnetic attractions involved in liquid oxygen?","id":"fa23eb1f9bcfa348a680bbe2c","answers":[]},{"question":"What are O molecules in triplet form?","id":"baeeae05a48fcb5debfbc4a9c","answers":[]},{"question":"Why are O molecules paramagnetic?","id":"cfafa2ec35b4d42bca4fdaf4f","answers":[]},{"question":"What is attracted to the poles of a powerful magnet?","id":"e6ecb675beac4699eb040eecb","answers":[]}],"context":"In the triplet form, O\n2 molecules are paramagnetic.

The three richest people in the world possess more financial assets than the lowest 48 nations combined. The combined wealth of the \"10 million dollar millionaires\" grew to nearly $41 trillion in 2008. A January 2014 report by Oxfam claims that the 85 wealthiest individuals in the world have a combined wealth equal to that of the bottom 50% of the world's population, or about 3.5 billion people. According to a Los Angeles Times analysis of the report, the wealthiest 1% owns 46% of the world's wealth; the 85 richest people, a small part of the wealthiest 1%, own about 0.7% of the human population's wealth, which is the same as the bottom half of the population. More recently, in January 2015, Oxfam reported that the wealthiest 1 percent will own more than half of the global wealth by 2016. An October 2014 study by Credit Suisse also claims that the top 1% now own nearly half of the world's wealth and that the accelerating disparity could trigger a recession. In October 2015, Credit Suisse published a study which shows global inequality continues to increase, and that half of the world's wealth is now in the hands of those in the top percentile, whose assets each exceed $759,900. A 2016 report by Oxfam claims that the 62 wealthiest individuals own as much wealth as the poorer half of the global population combined. Oxfam's claims have however been questioned on the basis of the methodology used: by using net wealth (adding up assets and subtracting debts), the Oxfam report, for instance, finds that there are more poor people in the United States and Western Europe than in China (due to a greater tendency to take on debts).[unreliable source?][unreliable source?] Anthony Shorrocks, the lead author of the Credit Suisse report which is one of the sources of Oxfam's data, considers the criticism about debt to be a \"silly argument\" and \"a non-issue . . . a diversion.\""},{"qas":[{"question":"How many Americans are richer than more than half of all citizens?","id":"7ec7321b3cfa1cfa413a9dc8d","answers":[]},{"question":"What publication printed that the wealthiest 1% have more money than those in the bottom 90%?","id":"3778f5d9fed3aeca31139eda2","answers":[]},{"question":"What is considered as a potential advantage for wealth for some Americans?","id":"e83cc4041eb25d587da75f1e2","answers":[]},{"question":"What did the richest 400 Americans have as children that helped them be successful adults?","id":"a3437020b6e960e5e31d7c40d","answers":[]},{"question":"What do the top 400 richest Americans have more of than half of all Americans combined?","id":"7eb8bd7fe139bbedbbc834ba0","answers":[]},{"question":"Who owns more wealth than the bottom 90 percent of people in the U.S.?","id":"edecc0ff09fcbab6b61f1af41","answers":[]},{"question":"What may explain why some Americans who've become rich may have had a head start?","id":"fb2dc1eaddc68ccef5b8f0da4","answers":[]},{"question":"How many of the richest 400 Americans grew up in substantial privilege?","id":"cc20bcd46da4facfa56dd7b7e","answers":[]},{"question":"What Institute published findings in September 2012 regarding the Forbes richest 400 Americans?","id":"98fc68de43d90770cc6a13958","answers":[]},{"question":"How many Americans are richer than less than half of all citizens?","id":"0cb9c40798163fca0f0f9fb7c","answers":[]},{"question":"What publication printed that the wealthiest 1% have more money than those in the bottom 99%?","id":"afd9dcc7a9d47e8025e5746ad","answers":[]},{"question":"What is considered as a potential disadvantage for wealth for some Americans?","id":"fc4a3e46ebdddcdcfeb4f83c4","answers":[]},{"question":"What did the richest 40 Americans have as children that helped them be successful adults?","id":"ab77b7f040f13dcfcf3c82aec","answers":[]},{"question":"What do the top 400 richest Americans have less of than half of all Americans combined?","id":"ff8d1809456aada4665c4eafb","answers":[]}],"context":"According to PolitiFact the top 400 richest Americans \"have more wealth than half of all Americans combined.\" According to the New York Times on July 22, 2014, the \"richest 1 percent in the United States now own more wealth than the bottom 90 percent\".

In fact, it differs from the present high school education, which is regarded as a stepping-stone to acquire college and advanced degrees. This decrease in wages caused a period of compression and decreased inequality between skilled and unskilled workers.

Lagerlof and Galor stated that gender inequality in education can result to low economic growth, and continued gender inequality in education, thus creating a poverty trap.

When rich countries trade with poor countries, the low-skilled workers in the rich countries may see reduced wages as a result of the competition, while low-skilled workers in the poor countries may see increased wages. Trade economist Paul Krugman estimates that trade liberalisation has had a measurable effect on the rising inequality in the United States. He attributes this trend to increased trade with poor countries and the fragmentation of the means of production, resulting in low skilled jobs becoming more tradeable. However, he concedes that the effect of trade on inequality in America is minor when compared to other causes, such as technological innovation, a view shared by other experts. Empirical economists Max Roser and Jesus Crespo-Cuaresma find support in the data that international trade is increasing income inequality. They empirically confirm the predictions of the Stolper\u2013Samuelson theorem regarding the effects of international trade on the distribution of incomes. Lawrence Katz estimates that trade has only accounted for 5-15% of rising income inequality. Robert Lawrence argues that technological innovation and automation has meant that low-skilled jobs have been replaced by machine labor in wealthier nations, and that wealthier countries no longer have significant numbers of low-skilled manufacturing workers that could be affected by competition from poor countries."},{"qas":[{"question":"What is the income inequality gap between genders in Botswana?","id":"1d6f01a6ead52583f1bbd9df9","answers":[]},{"question":"What is the gender income inequality in Bahrain?","id":"ff47bccf0ef2ef494c42cbaa6","answers":[]},{"question":"What is attributed to the income inequality in the United States?","id":"eabbe93c45c5aa1323dceb1aa","answers":[]},{"question":"Who does the wage gap between genders provide an advantage?","id":"d14dff3df939cc4fae8312daf","answers":[]},{"question":"In many countries, what kind of pay gap is there?","id":"f41f7698cf9466f7cc798f9f2","answers":[]},{"question":"Who does a gender pay gap tend to favor?","id":"66dbb2acdfbd4ba8691cb57df","answers":[]},{"question":"What gender is less willing to travel or relocate for work?","id":"76dbaec0474d088a06f7e9bdb","answers":[]},{"question":"Who is the author of the book, \"Knowledge and Decisions\"?","id":"dd64c19bbab88b7aeebaa1eca","answers":[]},{"question":"What does a U.S. census report state that even after other factors there still exists this between earnings of men and women?","id":"bea2dbace1628cef5ad9bb877","answers":[]},{"question":"What isn't the income inequality gap between genders in Botswana?","id":"3bfdcce6a9cc310dcca9c2ff1","answers":[]},{"question":"What isn't the gender income inequality in Bahrain?","id":"e6e2741bb2cbfc5cef5b6b852","answers":[]},{"question":"What is attributed to the income inequality in the United Nations?","id":"2ade353bd62fdc40f7dac5dfa","answers":[]},{"question":"Who does the wage gap between genders provide a disadvantage?","id":"a0c36e3bc433f2eeeb8fca99b","answers":[]},{"question":"In many countries, what kind of pay gap isn't there?","id":"4c3b6c994ffdb44a18cdce0e7","answers":[]}],"context":"In many countries, there is a Gender pay gap in favor of males in the labor market.

Eventually, through various possible redistribution mechanisms such as social welfare programs, more developed countries move back to lower levels of inequality."},{"qas":[{"question":"During what time period did income inequality decrease in the United States?","id":"3c207f336287ab25ca4f63d2b","answers":[]},{"question":"When did income inequality begin to increase in the US?","id":"aea3e04f4d113cbd53ae1b186","answers":[]},{"question":"In what sector are jobs beginning to increase?","id":"50b6c6afd9c84be98ab8dcfad","answers":[]},{"question":"In what sector are jobs beginning to decrease?","id":"d1cd22ce5cec9f6fc10f50c53","answers":[]},{"question":"Who plotted the relationships between levels of income and inequality?","id":"ab078f5f12ce40ca67ed9fb7c","answers":[]},{"question":"What is a a developing economy's level of inequality bulging out called?","id":"914acd2c2dae4b923cf4e8a00","answers":[]},{"question":"What has recent testing of Kuznets theory with superior data show it to be?","id":"b7aa08af9bac5d8d624b59ce8","answers":[]},{"question":"What does Kuznets' curve predict about income inequality given time?","id":"efcf3dbe12eac7ee7bcfd7f4f","answers":[]},{"question":"What may be possible for multiple Kuznets' cycles to be in at any given time?","id":"8ca7cce5b861ebf5c2cd9dee7","answers":[]},{"question":"During what time period did income inequality increase in the United States?","id":"12e14a902828f8bc7c16b8dfe","answers":[]},{"question":"When did income inequality begin to decrease in the US?","id":"2d325b7d7cd279dea56f3d9aa","answers":[]},{"question":"In what sector are jobs beginning to decrease?","id":"146e37a9ee3414bf657cdafd5","answers":[]},{"question":"In what sector are jobs beginning to increase?","id":"928fda07195bef9eef6a1a22e","answers":[]},{"question":"Who never plotted the relationships between levels of income and inequality?","id":"af6ad970ed294af94de6cef93","answers":[]}],"context":"Plotting the relationship between level of income and inequality, Kuznets saw middle-income developing economies level of inequality bulging out to form what is now known as the Kuznets curve.

Kuznets' curve predicts that income inequality will eventually decrease given time. As an example, income inequality did fall in the United States during its High school movement from 1910 to 1940 and thereafter.[citation needed] However, recent data shows that the level of income inequality began to rise after the 1970s.

The mechanism by which Y. pestis was usually transmitted was established in 1898 by Paul-Louis Simond and was found to involve the bites of fleas whose midguts had become obstructed by replicating Y. pestis several days after feeding on an infected host. This blockage results in starvation and aggressive feeding behaviour by the fleas, which repeatedly attempt to clear their blockage by regurgitation, resulting in thousands of plague bacteria being flushed into the feeding site, infecting the host. The bubonic plague mechanism was also dependent on two populations of rodents: one resistant to the disease, which act as hosts, keeping the disease endemic, and a second that lack resistance. When the second population dies, the fleas move on to other hosts, including people, thus creating a human epidemic."},{"qas":[{"question":"Who wrote about the great pestilence in 1893?","id":"bdd9b6dcb8cf5b10be7642aff","answers":[]},{"question":"What did Gasquet think the plague was?","id":"ed653cceb2bbdc3ff5a4a5cd3","answers":[]},{"question":"When did the second edition of Gasquet's book come out?","id":"014f2fbac8c45badbaad5f2c0","answers":[]},{"question":"What did Gasquet's book blame the plague on?","id":"bde59ffab7063876ef841ec85","answers":[]},{"question":"What is another plague thought to have spread the same way?","id":"67e082fc47b2bdc1736eff2be","answers":[]},{"question":"When was Francis Aidan Gasquet born?","id":"b13a5bfbc238a7fd28ccc5dd8","answers":[]},{"question":"When did the bubonic plague begin in Europe?","id":"f9eef7f5baa0320c4a2db98c4","answers":[]},{"question":"What was the Justinian plague epidemic called?","id":"2cdea332b6ffacef7761fe01d","answers":[]},{"question":"In what year was the Eastern Roman Empire established?","id":"48aaebada00a9e27dd24b5e3a","answers":[]}],"context":"The historian Francis Aidan Gasquet wrote about the 'Great Pestilence' in 1893 and suggested that \"it would appear to be some form of the ordinary Eastern or bubonic plague\".

Scott and Duncan have argued that the pandemic was a form of infectious disease that characterise as hemorrhagic plague similar to Ebola. Archaeologist Barney Sloane has argued that there is insufficient evidence of the extinction of a large number of rats in the archaeological record of the medieval waterfront in London and that the plague spread too quickly to support the thesis that the Y. pestis was spread from fleas on rats; he argues that transmission must have been person to person. However, no single alternative solution has achieved widespread acceptance. Many scholars arguing for the Y. pestis as the major agent of the pandemic suggest that its extent and symptoms can be explained by a combination of bubonic plague with other diseases, including typhus, smallpox and respiratory infections. In addition to the bubonic infection, others point to additional septicemic (a type of \"blood poisoning\") and pneumonic (an airborne plague that attacks the lungs before the rest of the body) forms of the plague, which lengthen the duration of outbreaks throughout the seasons and help account for its high mortality rate and additional recorded symptoms.

At least 60% of the population of Hamburg and Bremen perished, and a similar percentage of Londoners may have died from the disease as well.

Before 1350, there were about 170,000 settlements in Germany, and this was reduced by nearly 40,000 by 1450. In 1348, the plague spread so rapidly that before any physicians or government authorities had time to reflect upon its origins, about a third of the European population had already perished.

In the Early Pleistocene, the Rhine followed a course to the northwest, through the present North Sea. During the so-called Anglian glaciation (~450,000 yr BP, marine oxygen isotope stage 12), the northern part of the present North Sea was blocked by the ice and a large lake developed, that overflowed through the English Channel.

Although the allies could probably have prevented the re-occupation, Britain and France were not inclined to do so, a feature of their policy of appeasement to Hitler."},{"qas":[{"question":"Where is the Rhine Bridge?","id":"028fc4efbcffbcd681fd8d1a4","answers":[]},{"question":"What was the Rhine considered to invaders in WWII?","id":"cbee6740b0cc0e6a9104cf17c","answers":[]},{"question":"When was Operation Market Garden?","id":"d3b7d28ea1aea74fdabab5e99","answers":[]},{"question":"What bridge did the Germans fail to demolish?","id":"dc7b4ac2dd33c5d427ad18ce8","answers":[]},{"question":"What was the Warsaw Pact war plan?","id":"afa9116ebddc028cb005cba7d","answers":[]},{"question":"During what war did the Western Allies cross the Rhine bridge at Arnhem?","id":"1a1bcfb08edce3aa89fdfa1ea","answers":[]},{"question":"When did the Operation Market Garden of September end?","id":"9dc1a6bcfe12b7575caacc3f5","answers":[]},{"question":"When did the Cold War begin?","id":"32f2e5ccecf8f2665be7f6b5d","answers":[]},{"question":"How long did the Cold War last?","id":"ec83ea8d6ebfa6c5aebc91d68","answers":[]},{"question":"How many days did the U.S. forces participate in the Cold War?","id":"feaac5fbc4cadf0be41eaa6bb","answers":[]}],"context":"In World War II, it was recognised that the Rhine would present a formidable natural obstacle to the invasion of Germany, by the Western Allies.

This rock can be weathered and eroded, and then redeposited and lithified into a sedimentary rock, or be turned into a metamorphic rock due to heat and pressure that change the mineral content of the rock which gives it a characteristic fabric. The sedimentary rock can then be subsequently turned into a metamorphic rock due to heat and pressure and is then weathered, eroded, deposited, and lithified, ultimately becoming a sedimentary rock.

Arcs of volcanoes and earthquakes were explained as convergent boundaries, where one plate subducts under another. Transform boundaries, such as the San Andreas fault system, resulted in widespread powerful earthquakes. Plate tectonics also provided a mechanism for Alfred Wegener's theory of continental drift, in which the continents move across the surface of the Earth over geologic time.

Because rock units, other than muds, do not significantly change in volume, this is accomplished in two primary ways: through faulting and folding. In the shallow crust, where brittle deformation can occur, thrust faults form, which cause deeper rock to move on top of shallower rock. Because deeper rock is often older, as noted by the principle of superposition, this can result in older rocks moving on top of younger ones. Movement along faults can result in folding, either because the faults are not planar or because rock layers are dragged along, forming drag folds as slip occurs along the fault. Deeper in the Earth, rocks behave plastically, and fold instead of faulting. These folds can either be those where the material in the center of the fold buckles upwards, creating \"antiforms\", or where it buckles downwards, creating \"synforms\". If the tops of the rock units within the folds remain pointing upwards, they are called anticlines and synclines, respectively. If some of the units in the fold are facing downward, the structure is called an overturned anticline or syncline, and if all of the rock units are overturned or the correct up-direction is unknown, they are simply called by the most general terms, antiforms and synforms."},{"qas":[{"question":"This causes the rock unit as a whole to become longer and thinner.

Continual motion along the fault maintains the topographic gradient in spite of the movement of sediment, and continues to create accommodation space for the material to deposit. Deformational events are often also associated with volcanism and igneous activity. Volcanic ashes and lavas accumulate on the surface, and igneous intrusions enter from below. Dikes, long, planar igneous intrusions, enter along cracks, and therefore often form in large numbers in areas that are being actively deformed.

The Hawaiian Islands, for example, consist almost entirely of layered basaltic lava flows. The sedimentary sequences of the mid-continental United States and the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States contain almost-undeformed stacks of sedimentary rocks that have remained in place since Cambrian time. Other areas are much more geologically complex. In the southwestern United States, sedimentary, volcanic, and intrusive rocks have been metamorphosed, faulted, foliated, and folded. Even older rocks, such as the Acasta gneiss of the Slave craton in northwestern Canada, the oldest known rock in the world have been metamorphosed to the point where their origin is undiscernable without laboratory analysis. In addition, these processes can occur in stages. In many places, the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States being a very visible example, the lower rock units were metamorphosed and deformed, and then deformation ended and the upper, undeformed units were deposited.

The tract's boundaries were Balch Avenue on the south, Cedar Avenue on the east, the rear property line of Platt Avenue (east of Sixth Street) and Platt Avenue (west of Sixth Street) on the north, and First Street on the west. The subdivision was annexed to the City in January 1912, in an election that was the first in which women voted in the community. At the time of its admission to the City, the Alta Vista Tract was uninhabited but landscaped, although the trees had to be watered by tank wagon. In 1914 developers Billings & Meyering acquired the tract, completed street development, provided the last of the necessary municipal improvements including water service, and began marketing the property with fervor. A mere half decade later the tract had 267 homes.

The initial 235 acres (0.95 km2), combined with additional acres acquired later by the City, brings the park to a sizable 300 acres (1.2 km2). Now packed with amenities, Woodward Park is the only Regional Park of its size in the Central Valley. The Southeast corner of the park harbors numerous bird species offering bird enthusiasts an excellent opportunity for viewing. The park has a multi-use amphitheatre that seats up to 2,500 people, authentic Japanese Garden, fenced dog park, two-mile (3 km) equestrian trail, exercise par course, three children's playgrounds, a lake, 3 small ponds, 7 picnic areas and five miles (8 km) of multipurpose trails that are part of the San Joaquin River Parkway's Lewis S. Eaton Trail. When complete, the Lewis S. Eaton trail system will cover 22 miles (35 km) between Highway 99 and Friant Dam. The park's numerous picnic tables make for a great picnic destination and a convenient escape from city life. The park's amphetheatre was renovated in 2010, and has hosted performances by acts such as Deftones, Tech N9ne, and Sevendust as well as numerous others.

The Fully Informed Jury Association's publication \"A Primer for Prospective Jurors\" notes, \"Think of the dilemma faced by German citizens when Hitler's secret police demanded to know if they were hiding a Jew in their house.\" By this definition, civil disobedience could be traced back to the Book of Exodus, where Shiphrah and Puah refused a direct order of Pharaoh but misrepresented how they did it.

It has also been argued that either choice is compatible with the spirit of civil disobedience. ACT-UP's Civil Disobedience Training handbook states that a civil disobedient who pleads guilty is essentially stating, \"Yes, I committed the act of which you accuse me. I don't deny it; in fact, I am proud of it.

The necessity defense has sometimes been used as a shadow defense by civil disobedients to deny guilt without denouncing their politically motivated acts, and to present their political beliefs in the courtroom. However, court cases such as U.S. v. Schoon have greatly curtailed the availability of the political necessity defense.

Analyses of sediment deposits from Amazon basin paleolakes and from the Amazon Fan indicate that rainfall in the basin during the LGM was lower than for the present, and this was almost certainly associated with reduced moist tropical vegetation cover in the basin. There is debate, however, over how extensive this reduction was. Some scientists argue that the rainforest was reduced to small, isolated refugia separated by open forest and grassland; other scientists argue that the rainforest remained largely intact but extended less far to the north, south, and east than is seen today. This debate has proved difficult to resolve because the practical limitations of working in the rainforest mean that data sampling is biased away from the center of the Amazon basin, and both explanations are reasonably well supported by the available data."},{"qas":[{"question":"What is the name of the satellite that measured the amount of dust?","id":"84abecc3e5668ad359d3e0bbc","answers":[]},{"question":"How many tons of dust are blown from the Sahara each year?","id":"e9eadcdfb45ac205be280dfde","answers":[]},{"question":"How many miles does the dust travels over the Atlantic Ocean?","id":"d98efbd298aa0ca4ddd28d67b","answers":[]},{"question":"Which basin does the dust falls over into?","id":"f7e7f3731e3eaaa6b6c67fc0b","answers":[]},{"question":"How many tons of dust remains in the air?","id":"8f6c4a469a8d2a832f6ee71ef","answers":[]},{"question":"What tool has measured the amount of dust that travels from the Sahara to the Amazon?","id":"2c0af42ddc7b7ba97bdbf75ea","answers":[]},{"question":"How much dust is blown out of the Sahara each year?","id":"a46c3ab28fcff0d3bfc66792f","answers":[]},{"question":"How much Saharan dust falls over the Amazon basin each year?","id":"fb94ce78a57976ba47e5eebc3","answers":[]},{"question":"How much Saharan dust remains in the air over the Amazon each year?","id":"9dfe7ba9e2aafdd08e0bd892b","answers":[]},{"question":"How much Saharan dust is blown and falls upon the Caribbean Sea each year?","id":"1eefccd8a9c0df8f8cbfe54ac","answers":[]},{"question":"A satellite that measured the amount of dust going to the Amazon was named what?","id":"a78a6e1b0a7c7647dd78bd8ac","answers":[]},{"question":"What organization runs the satellite that measured dust that landed on the Amazon?","id":"3abc5e639a87a4d00a5dcc2bd","answers":[]},{"question":"How much windblown dust leaves the Sahara each year?","id":"80330a6c7e66ae4babdfcbd14","answers":[]},{"question":"How many miles across the Atlantic Ocean does Saharan dust travel?","id":"896ec0ae635fdbde3b3af6227","answers":[]},{"question":"How many tons of Saharan dust falls on the Amazon Basin each year?","id":"f5dd77ffc716eb41f106e5c9a","answers":[]},{"question":"What is the name of the satellite that measured the amount of vegetation from the so hard to the Amazon?","id":"f9c030d9bc8e5f0b4d52b7041","answers":[]},{"question":"How many tons of dust are blown from the rain forest each year?","id":"dfddd1b462a444ead6d580cad","answers":[]},{"question":"How many miles is a dust travel over the Pacific?","id":"6cb995b9bfab7efaccccdd95a","answers":[]},{"question":"How much dust is blown into the sonar every year","id":"4dc6f30ac6aecb4a60d9cad5d","answers":[]},{"question":"48 million tons of dust are blown onto what C every year?","id":"2ddbc9a9de17bcac11b32ec08","answers":[]}],"context":"NASA's CALIPSO satellite has measured the amount of dust transported by wind from the Sahara to the Amazon: an average 182 million tons of dust are windblown out of the Sahara each year, at 15 degrees west longitude, across 1,600 miles (2,600 km) over the Atlantic Ocean (some dust falls into the Atlantic), then at 35 degrees West longitude at the eastern coast of South America, 27.7 million tons (15%) of dust fall over the Amazon basin, 132 million tons of dust remain in the air, 43 million tons of dust are windblown and falls on the Caribbean Sea, past 75 degrees west longitude."},{"qas":[{"question":"What is the name of the book written by Archeologist Betty Meggers?","id":"ce21f9ddff48edfcf05d41ad0","answers":[]},{"question":"What is the maximum square miles did Betty Meggers claim that can be sustained in the rainforest?

She claimed that a population density of 0.2 inhabitants per square kilometre (0.52\/sq mi) is the maximum that can be sustained in the rainforest through hunting, with agriculture needed to host a larger population. However, recent anthropological findings have suggested that the region was actually densely populated. Some 5 million people may have lived in the Amazon region in AD 1500, divided between dense coastal settlements, such as that at Maraj\u00f3, and inland dwellers.

R\u00e9n (\u4ec1, 'benevolence' or 'humaneness') is the essence of the human being which manifests as compassion. It is the virtue-form of Heaven. Y\u00ec (\u7fa9\/\u4e49) is the upholding of righteousness and the moral disposition to do good. L\u01d0 (\u79ae\/\u793c) is a system of ritual norms and propriety that determines how a person should properly act in everyday life in harmony with the law of Heaven. Zh\u00ec (\u667a) is the ability to see what is right and fair, or the converse, in the behaviors exhibited by others.

The ability to make such orders is also based on express or implied Acts of Congress that delegate to the President some degree of discretionary power (delegated legislation). Like both legislative statutes and regulations promulgated by government agencies, executive orders are subject to judicial review and may be overturned if the orders lack support by statute or the Constitution. Major policy initiatives require approval by the legislative branch, but executive orders have significant influence over the internal affairs of government, deciding how and to what degree legislation will be enforced, dealing with emergencies, waging wars, and in general fine-tuning policy choices in the implementation of broad statutes.
