        ###        self.char_output_projection: Linear layer, called W_{dec} and b_{dec} in the PDF

        ### Hint: - Use target_vocab.char2id to access the character vocabulary for the target language.
        ###       - Set the padding_idx argument of the embedding matrix.
        ###       - Create a new Embedding layer. Do not reuse embeddings created in Part 1 of this assignment.
