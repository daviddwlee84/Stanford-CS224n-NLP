\title{CS224n Assignment 4: \\ Neural Machine Translation}
\author{David Lee}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\section{Neural Machine Translation with RNNs}
\subsection*{(g) First explain (in around three sentences) what effect the masks have on the entire attention com- putation. Then explain (in one or two sentences) why it is necessary to use the masks in this way.}

\section{Analyzing NMT Systems}
\subsection{For each example of a Spanish source sentence, reference English translation, and NMT English translation}
% 1. Identify the error in the NMT translation.
% 2. Provide a reason why the model may have made the error (either due to a specific linguistic construct or specific model limitations).
% 3. Describe one possible way we might alter the NMT system to fix the observed error.
\subsubsection{\textbf{Reference Translation}: \textit{So another one of my favorites, “The Starry Night”.} \\ \textbf{NMT Translation}: \textit{Here’s another favorite of my favorites, “The Starry Night”.}}

\subsubsection{\textbf{Reference Translation}: \textit{You know, what I do is write for children, and I’m probably America’s most widely read children’s author, in fact.} \\ \textbf{NMT Translation}: \textit{You know what I do is write for children, and in fact, I’m probably the author for children, more reading in the U.S.}}

\subsubsection{\textbf{Reference Translation}: \textit{A friend of mine did that – Richard \underline{Bolingbroke}.} \\ \textbf{NMT Translation}: \textit{A friend of mine did that – Richard <unk>}}

\subsubsection{\textbf{Reference Translation}: \textit{You’ve just got to go around the block to see it as an epiphany.} \\ \textbf{NMT Translation}: \textit{ou just have to go back to the apple to see it as a epiphany.}}

\subsubsection{\textbf{Reference Translation}: \textit{She saved my life by letting me go to the bathroom in the teachers’ lounge.} \\ \textbf{NMT Translation}: \textit{She saved my life by letting me go to the bathroom in the women’s room.}}

\subsubsection{\textbf{Reference Translation}: \textit{That’s more than 250 thousand acres.} \\ \textbf{NMT Translation}: \textit{That’s over 100,000 acres.}}

\subsection{Please identify 2 different examples of errors that your model produced.}
% 1. Write the source sentence in Spanish. The source sentences are in the en_es_data/test.es.
% 2. Write the reference English translation. The reference translations are in the en_es_data/test.en.
% 3. Write your NMT model’s English translation. The model-translated sentences are in the outputs/test outputs.txt.
% 4. Identify the error in the NMT translation.
% 5. Provide a reason why the model may have made the error (either due to a specific linguistic
% construct or specific model limitations).
% 6. Describe one possible way we might alter the NMT system to fix the observed error.

\subsection{Please consider this example:}

\paragraph{Reference Translation $r_1$: love can always find a way Reference \\ Translation $r_2$: love makes anything possible \\
NMT Translation $c_1$: the love can always do \\
NMT Translation $c_2$: love can make anything possible}

\subsubsection{Compute the BLEU scores for $c_1$ and $c_2$. And answer which of the two NMT translations is considered the better translation according to the BLEU Score? Do you agree that it is the better translation?}

\subsubsection{Recompute BLEU scores for $c_1$ and $c_2$, this time with respect to $r_1$ only. Which of the two NMT translations now receives the higher BLEU score? Do you agree that it is the better translation?}

\subsubsection{Please explain (in a few sentences) why "NMT systems are often evaluated with respect to only a single reference translation (due to data availability)" may be problematic.}

\subsubsection{List two advantages and two disadvantages of BLEU, compared to human evaluation, as an evaluation metric for Machine Translation.}
