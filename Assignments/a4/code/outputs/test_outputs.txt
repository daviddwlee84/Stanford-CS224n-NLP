You know what I do is write for the kids, and, in fact, I probably am the author for children, more read in the U.S.
And I always tell the people I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can tell you as farmer, or with leather clothes, and nobody has chosen a farmer.
I'm here to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany generally is something that fell somewhere.
You just have to turn the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the paint of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the complicated kind of circle I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the middle school, in average, <unk> Ohio where I was the rare of the class.
When I went to bleeding every week in the bathroom of the boys, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me go into the bathroom room.
I would make it a secret, thing.
For three years.
And I had to go out of the city.
He had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the <unk> I felt the need to start working on organizations fighting AIDS.
About three or four years ago, half of the night I got a phone call from that <unk> the lady <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I'm sure that adults never come to know us.
You could get it to Ohio and please bring that man that I know you've been found.
And I must tell you that I have pancreatic cancer, and I would like you to stand up with this, please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
And we went to see it, and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, the <unk> and the <unk> and we took away from her family, because I was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because I was necessary, because it was necessary, because I was necessary, because it was necessary, because I was necessary, because it was necessary, because it
It's something we knew what to do.
And as a woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> it became a box of cinders and was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle had closed -- it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I told you about it became present in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save the her.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that I was talking about this.
It needs to -- needs dignity, love and pleasure.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quickly, I was trying to understand what was in front of me.
I put them around the water almost 60 feet -- and I couldn't more than think it was a <unk> on another <unk> year after year.
<unk> are born when they fall from the glaciers or they break the walls of ice.
Every iceberg has their own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment, and their experiences.
Some of them refuse to give up and hold hold up to the end, whereas others can't afford them more and they were <unk> on a <unk> <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated and separated and alone, as we see ourselves sometimes as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> it's going to be a <unk> I'm breathing its atmosphere.
As a iceberg, it releases freshwater rich in minerals that feeds a lot of life.
I come up to photograph these <unk> as if it was the portraits of my ancestors, knowing that in these unique moments exist in that way and will not exist in that way again.
It's not the death when you <unk> it's not an end, but one of its way for the cycle of life.
Part of the ice of the <unk> that I photograph is very <unk> has a couple thousand years old.
And another part of the ice is over 100,000 years.
The last pictures I'd like to show you is from a iceberg that I photographed at <unk> Greenland.
It's <unk> to actually get a <unk> iceberg to see.
Here you are.
You can see the left one boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your baseline line.
You can see here, it starts to <unk> the ship has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
This is an <unk> iceberg from average.
It's about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two partners in 1979, the same day, every single one -- a baby.
So, two couples each with a baby.
I don't want you to stand too much on the details of conception, because if you stop thinking about the conception of itself, I'm not going to pay attention.
So let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in a case, the <unk> and the sperm is joined the X chromosome from the <unk>
And in the other case, the X X chromosome is combined to the X chromosome from the <unk>
Both <unk> and it starts life.
We'll go back and talk about them later.
In my ground ground I would get two roles.
In one of my <unk> I work with the anatomy.
I am <unk> by training and what I study in this case is the way people <unk> the anatomy -- to say, from human bodies, what have been considered body fluids.
The other role that performance works in my work is an activist, as a <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features defy social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with fraternal twins two people inside a body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much lower than the average.
And I've worked with many cases of people with <unk> sex with individuals whose physical typology -- not fit into the male and conventional female <unk>
We can <unk> <unk>
<unk> it takes a lot of forms.
I'm going to put some examples in ways of having a sex that's not being eaten in the common or female form.
For example, there's the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> which is called the <unk> which is the <unk> that we all have in the <unk> life that we have to get away.
And then, in the <unk> life, the testes are producing testosterone.
But because this individual lacks testosterone, the body doesn't react to the same.
It's <unk> syndrome to <unk>
So, there are high levels of testosterone but without reaction.
As a result, the body is typically <unk> <unk>
When you look at the baby you have a little bit of a little girl.
It's a little girl. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing up and developing the breast -- but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes that something is happening.
And then you realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> it actually has <unk> and a y chromosome.
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's actually not that way.
Women like men, we have in the body something called <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk>
Most of the women like me -- I think a <unk> woman doesn't know his structure, and I believe being a typical woman most women like me are responsive to the <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a consequence, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with testicles that have the <unk> syndrome that has <unk> syndrome.
So sex is a complicated thing, it's not that <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some form can be everywhere.
Another example, a few years ago, a few years ago, I got a call from a 19 years old, born and raised as <unk> had girlfriend, and sexual relationships with her, carried a life as a boy and I had just found that he had <unk> and <unk>
It had a extreme way of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had the 20th century and in the uterus -- the <unk> glands were so active that in essence, created a hormone hormone environment.
As a result, his genitals were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormonal component, typically male.
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk> anything.
And it was the age 19 when he started having a criminal problem caused by the internal <unk> when the doctors discovered that, in fact, it was a woman in it.
Well, another example of a case of <unk>
Some people with the 20th century develop what is known as <unk> is to say, you have tissue <unk> wrapped in <unk> tissue.
We don't know exactly why that happens.
So, there's a lot of sex.
The reason that children with this kind of bodies -- if you are <unk> fraternal twins or <unk> <unk> surgery, it's not to be able to have a better physical health better.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason you get to various surgeries is that it's a threat to our social categories.
The system is based on the idea of the idea that a particular anatomy brings to <unk> a particular identity.
We have the idea that being a woman is to have an African identity is to have <unk> <unk> to be a black anatomy in terms of historical terms.
A terribly simplistic idea.
And when you presented a body that shows something quite different, we have a problem with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture of <unk>
Our nation is based on a very romantic.
So imagine how amazing it is to have children that are born like two people inside a body.
The most greatest case is last year with the <unk> South <unk> <unk> <unk> put on the fabric of his sex in the <unk> <unk>
A lot of journalists called to wonder: "What do they do to do to figure out whether to say, <unk> is a man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the reporters that there is no such a test.
In fact, we know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature is so complicated that nature doesn't plot a <unk> line between men and women or between men and <unk> and women and <unk> are us who we map that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more of the science, the more we have to admit that these categories -- we thought that these categories -- we thought that these categories would be, directly to be able to be able to be able to be able to admit that directly with <unk> categories, which are much more <unk> than they <unk>
And not only in sex.
Also in terms of race -- something that is much more complicated than the terminology <unk>
So as we see, we go on a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What about the fact of <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as it comes to the science of science, we get more and more in a very uncomfortable zone that we have to recognize that the <unk> categories are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, is the struggles at the beginning and in the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today <unk> not in public, but I know within the <unk> about when someone is considered died.
Our ancestors never had to do it with this question of whether somebody was dead.
As long as they put a pen in front of the nose, and if he moved it still yet.
If I stopped moving the <unk>
But today, we can, for example, to extract vital organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a consequence, we have to deal with a dilemma of determining the death of what somebody's death, and this puts us in a difficult situation, where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And maybe think that this explosion of categories could be happy to someone like me.
And in politics I'm progressive, I am fighting people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that it puts me nervous.
And so they would argue that these categories are much more fragile than we thought it was about.
It is from the standpoint of the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I am a fervent fan of mine.
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and bold and so radical in what they did, that I find each other watching that musical <unk> <unk> and not by music, which is totally <unk>
It's what happened in <unk> with Parents <unk>
Parents <unk> were, for me, the first activists on the anatomy and explain why.
What they had, was a <unk> concept, and it was <unk> with another which was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as they all remember, what we <unk> our Parents <unk> was the idea of <unk> The monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs in the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that it was going to be able to be able to be able to be able to political power for the right of blood being passed from the grandfather and then the son, and so on.
Parents <unk> rejected that idea and replacing it for a new concept concept and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the game camp and decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy of common and not <unk> differences, that was very radical.
And partly they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and the same time <unk> science.
And it's very clear -- if you look at the history of Parents <unk> that many people were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> from the <unk> explanations -- so they would be able to have the concept of power being passed by the concept of an idea of <unk>
They were moving towards a unified concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of <unk> they talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And as a result, they were passing the idea of gravity.
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future <unk> movement.
They didn't think that way, but they did it for us, and it was great.
And what happened years next?
And the women were <unk>
Then the success of the Civil Rights Movement was involved with people from <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the lines of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
And again, people of color are going to lead to <unk> <unk> about the <unk> difference, and again, <unk>
We see the same with the <unk> movement.
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we need to start asking why we keep certain <unk>
But attention -- I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights to a human.
I don't want to say that we should be aware of the anatomy.
I don't want to say that the children in five years should be allowed to have sex or married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me and I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try and figure out what they are, why keep them and make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two <unk> at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the <unk> exactly the same day.
So let's imagine that one of them, Mary, was born three months before I time: June 1, 1980.
<unk> the other thing was born in term: <unk> the March 1 1980.
For the fact that I was born three months before Mary were attributed to all the rights, three months before Henry -- the right of sexual consent, the right to vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different biological age, but because it was born later.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, to virtue of being a man -- if I don't have told you if it's <unk> by virtue of being considered to be a man now is <unk> from the immortal <unk> that Mary doesn't have to worry.
You know, for his hand, it doesn't have the same marriage of marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can be married in all states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman just in some states.
So there are still <unk> categories that in various aspects are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science moved both in the field of the anatomy that we get to the point of having to say that a democracy based on the anatomy could be <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science is moving.
Where do we go from here?
It seems that what happens in our culture is kind of a kind of <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to trace the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people are stuck in a rare position.
For example, Texas at a certain time has decided to get married with a man doesn't have to have a chromosome, and that to get married with a woman has to have the y chromosome.
Now, in practice, they don't make tests for the people.
But this is also very strange for the story that I told you at the beginning of <unk> syndrome to the <unk>
If we look at one of the founders of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech "I love <unk> offers a solution.
It says that we should judge people who are <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the contents of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea seems very good."
But in practice, how do you do that?
How do people judge people based on their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that we should be able to take care of the rights to people, because I've to admit that I know some of them <unk> that they probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> I know you can make more intelligent and smart decisions about their sexual relationships than people of 40 that I know.
So how do you put the issue of content from <unk>
It's very hard.
And a part of me, what would happen if the character of a person could be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI machine.
We really want to get that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still going to lead this current of thinking of thinking about democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy, and I think we'll do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context as the Iranian man in which a man who feels like for other men is susceptible to being killed, unless they are willing to have a sex change in which case it is allowed to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like a surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago that he had made a couple of years ago that he had made the light <unk> and then they would pick up their name.
But when the phone asked him the reason was a very <unk> operation, he said that in that other country these children would be very <unk> and therefore had to do it.
I said, "Well, it's considered political asylum seekers rather than the separation of <unk>
The United States offers huge possibilities to the people who are <unk> to change the way of the state.
So I think we need to be on the head.
Well, to end up, I want to say I've been talking a lot about the <unk>
And I want to think about what democracy would be, or as it could have been, if we were given more participation to the <unk>
And I want to say something a little radical for a feminist, and that is that I think there may be different ideas coming from different <unk> <unk> particularly if there are people thinking about them.
Since years ago, because I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in research the sexual difference.
And one of the things that has been interested in are the differences between men and women in the way to think and operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, not all, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and care about those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
years ago, when I was at graduate school, one of my advisers who knew that I was interested in feminism -- I was considered <unk> as a <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what has the <unk>
And I thought, "It's the stupidest question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to do with rid of the stereotypes about gender, so there is nothing women's in <unk>
But the more I've thought about your question, most of me have seemed to me that there is some female in the <unk>
I mean, there could be something different on average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more committed to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if I did the dads were very attentive to find the way to protect the people in the state, it's possible that there are possible that there are more likely to be <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with the <unk>
And maybe that's what we have to do in the future when we make democracy beyond the <unk> think less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and think more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect <unk> think about what we do with each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided that we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where it wants to go to live and work, have the possibility to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new people."
Well, at this point, we're far away from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't count with a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that it's worth a lot more than their building cost.
So we could easily get rid of the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But they just put it out by buildings.
So imagine that half of those who wanted to live in apartments already -- and that in the other half still keeps it to do it.
You could try to increase the ability by making it <unk> in all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that we <unk> is that those buildings and the areas that surround them have norms to avoid <unk> and the <unk>
So it would be very difficult to do all those <unk>
But they could go to a totally new place, to build a whole new apartment building -- always and when the rules of that <unk> place the building instead of putting it up.
So I proposed that the governments to prescribe new reform areas to contain cities and I gave them a name, cities under <unk>
I later found that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reform Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 75 percent of their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009 <unk> happened for a constitutional constitutional crisis.
Over the next few elections, we have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a platform in which they <unk> reforms and the same time of reconciliation.
He asked <unk> who was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a huge amount of evidence with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to its most essential.
The first point was the importance of standards, like those rules that say you can't go and bother all the current residents of apartments.
It takes a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes a lot of technologies like norms for <unk> and usually they are the rules that keep us going forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent a <unk> a link to the <unk>
I showed you to <unk>
They called me up.
They said to me, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December us, we met in Miami, in a conference room.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable cities, much more valuable than its cost.
And I used this picture that shows the value of the land in a place like New York City, terrain that, in some cases, worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract argument and at some point, when there was a pause, he said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk described in very simple terms, which a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> terrain -- which is <unk> the rules that are <unk> there and a choice for people to be able to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> called me and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way that our country will move forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I would talk about the four and five of January.
So I came up with another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which I was trying to explain that for <unk> a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
This airport is covering more than 100 miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that you measure at least 1,000 miles.
That's more than 100,000 acres.
The whole world is <unk> <unk>
The faces of the audience were very serious and <unk>
The Congress leader came up to the platform, and he said, "Professor <unk> thank you very much for your talk, but maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
I'm here in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this explained how to tell you that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city that might be going to be in <unk> rather than hundreds of miles away to the North.
And also <unk> new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the government of <unk> would need help from <unk> countries that could benefit from the countries that help them to establish and make the rules of the <unk> so that they all could be able to trust the <unk> effectively <unk>
We went and saw a site.
This picture is there.
It could be a few thousand square miles.
And shortly later, the 19 of January, voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a constitutional available to allow them to create these special specialized regions of development.
In a country that I had just passed through this crisis that was the voting in Congress in the favor of this constitutional <unk> was from <unk> to one.
All the <unk> all the characteristics in the society, the <unk>
In the <unk> it has to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17, he passed it again.
Immediately after the voting on the 21 to 24 of February, a <unk> shifting <unk> was to the two places in the world that are most interested in participating in cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new big <unk> center in the city that is building in Korea, is bigger than the center of Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after four years was getting <unk>
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've built two cities in China, and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this, this is the point where we are.
They have a website, and they're already thinking about a site for the second city.
They are setting up a legal system that would allow the administrators to be able to be able to operate under an external legal system.
A country has already committed to allow their Supreme Court to be the last <unk> for this new <unk> system.
There are urban planners and builders, cities that are very interested in the project.
You can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that they've solved they've solved that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are a lot of companies that wanted to move on the <unk> especially in a place with an area of <unk> trade, and there are a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change the other place.
There's a million a year that comes out in Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave their family back to go get a job -- sometimes they are mothers, who have to make the money for just just eating or buying clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes there are even children who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in a decade.
So what do you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What does it look like to insist so that families can choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends <unk> I was asked to say, "Thank you."
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I just show you what's inside, I'm going to make a public confession -- and that's that I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find, dress, and more recently, photograph and post on my blog and <unk> colorful and different for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All of my clothes is from the second hand of <unk> and retail stores.
Ah, thank you.
The <unk> stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment, and in my <unk>
I go to know people who are <unk> usually my money is going to be a good <unk> My view is <unk> and buying it into my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
I will be from my size?
I would like <unk>
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all of the answers are positive, then I feel I've won.
So back to the subject of my <unk> I want to tell you what I was doing for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what brings it to someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I've brought seven pairs of clothes, and nothing else.
So inside for exactly a week that's all I've put in my <unk>
I thought it would be able to find everything else that I would like to use after I got to Palm <unk>
And because they don't know me as the woman who walks for TED in <unk>  that means I found some things.
And I would like to show you now the stolen sets of this week.
It doesn't sound that sounds interesting?
While I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that believe or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this brilliant tiger.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You can almost see it phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All of the together, including the <unk> took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've used in the week.
<unk> the color is energy.
It's almost impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other people happy.
<unk> <unk> is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time <unk>
You just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people, you don't just give you a lot of you."
<unk> <unk> of the child that you're inside.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems like I play <unk> or I remind them to be seven years old.
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> trust is the key.
If you think you do well with something, it's almost pretty sure you are.
And if you think you don't see you well with something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years that really understood their meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you believe that you're a beautiful person in your inner and the outside, you don't look at them that you can't see them.
So there's no excuse for anyone in this audience.
We must be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth, six words for you: <unk> gold <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a unique and unique form of telling the world something about you without having to say a word.
I tried it over and over again when people were approaching me this week just by what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home, Brooklyn, I'm going to give you all.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that we have to leave certain things.
I don't need to <unk> these things, because at the end of the corner, there will always be another crazy <unk> <unk> and bright <unk> if there is a little love in my heart and I go.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split into two parts.
The left side, which is the logical part, and the right side, which is the intuitive.
So, if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of every single <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For example, this would be a completely logical thing.
This would be a totally intuitive thing.
So where do you get your brain at this scale?
Some of them <unk> for one of these extremes, but I believe that for most of the members of this audience, their brain is something like that -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that they're <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, which just as most of the other quantum physicists <unk> we need pretty logic for <unk> these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need pretty intuition to make the experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put them into play with them and then we see as <unk> and then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
As a intuition that you can have developed with the step of the years is that it says that one thing can be only at a place at once.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born.
I remember watching a child playing in a parking bar.
It was a little boy, and he didn't do it very well, always <unk>
But I bet that play with that bar of parking lot was taught a valuable lesson, and that is that big things don't allow them to get them and stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except to be a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a physicist of particles, because they don't play with parking bars, play with these strange little particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of really odd things -- like they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And so they wrote all these observations, and they called the quantum mechanics.
At that point, I found the physics of the physics -- a few years ago; you needed the quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need to describe the big objects that surround us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because they don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not very much.
And I've never seen it.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit well to my logic.
Because if everything is made of little particles and all the small particles are still the principles of quantum mechanics, so I shouldn't have all to follow the principles of quantum mechanics.
I don't find the reason why it didn't work.
And therefore I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why some years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see has been on an overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the metal piece I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And I'm going to put it a little bit. It's right in the center.
And then we do a good approach to the little <unk> of metal.
What we see is a little bit of metal, with a springboard form, and that <unk> on a platform.
And so I did this almost the same way that you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new silicon chip -- and I set up all the great machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole with a swimming swimming pool, which is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum <unk> but for it needs a little help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable it is to be on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I am on an elevator alone, I do all kinds of weird, but then when other people go up and let them go up to doing those things, because I don't want them to love them -- or, actually, <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The <unk> of inanimate objects are not just people, it's also the light that <unk> it and the wind that goes on and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to behave with the quantum mechanics, we would have to <unk> all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
They took the lights out, then they <unk> a <unk> and we took it all the air out, and then we put it at a temperature of less than a degree for absolute zero.
Now, when you're just in the <unk> the little metal piece of metal is free to act like it.
So we measure their movements.
We found that it moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, I was vibrating. And the way it was going on, was like a breathing of this way -- like a <unk> which expands and <unk>
And when you give it a soft, we'd be able to make it <unk> and you don't get it at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that a <unk> thing and not <unk> at the same time?
So think about atoms.
In one case, every trillion atoms that make that metal piece of metal are still still and at the same time that same atoms are moving up and so on.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that the whole piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, look at this, the difference on scale between one single atom and that piece of metal is more or less the same as the difference between that little metal little bit of metal and you.
So if one atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that metal piece can be in two different places, why not you too?
I mean, it's the logic I talk about.
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, what would that be?
How to act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we got it, and we turned the lights and we looked inside the box, we saw that metal followed there in a single piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all of the objects in the elevator are actually only quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics claims that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not that true.
It's more than that, it's more profound.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things that surround you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep strangeness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing a Google job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something about museums and art to my head that's here and allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months to me.
A lot of negotiations and stories, they took it with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on <unk>
There's a lot of stories about why we did.
I think my own story is just explaining just on this slide and this is access.
I grew up in India.
I had a great education -- I didn't get sure but I had no access to many of these museums and works of art.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, I started to learn a lot.
And working on Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible through technology.
So we form a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
You'd better show that a demo to then tell you a couple of interesting things that we've done from his launch.
So let's go back to <unk>
Look around all the museums there.
There's the gallery at MoMA, the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorites, to the <unk> the art of New York City.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we're inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You are moving around and <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We open the roof, and, with one click, we jump inside.
You're inside, you want to go at the end of the road.
They're still going forward.
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk>
If the museum shows you the image, we click there.
See, this is one of the pictures.
Here's all the <unk> information.
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click on here right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured in what we call the <unk> technology.
So this picture, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million pixels.
And there are a lot of people who ask me, "And what do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'll show you what you really get with 10,000 million pixels.
It can zoom in in a very simple way.
You see things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression doesn't have a price.
But if you really want to look at it.
So I started to play, and I found something happening there.
And I said, "A moment, this seems like <unk>
I walked in, and I found that the kids were actually playing something.
And I did a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called the <unk> which is to hit a <unk> with a stick on the Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even deeper and deeper and see that you can actually get into the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to take the image, so you'll see really what there is.
This is where we were, and this is painting.
The best thing is to come, a second.
So now we're very quickly going to jump again at MoMA in New York City.
Here's another one of my favorites, "The night <unk>
The example I showed you was to find detail.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this piece of work.
It really increases it and really really <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> night -- I think I'd never seen it so before.
I'll show you another one of my favorite functions.
There's a lot more things over here, but I don't have any time of <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives the same way.
You can make your own museum, create your own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, we walked in, I've created this function that I call "The power of <unk> -- we've just got to do a zooming around it.
It's about "The <unk> at the National Gallery in London.
You can write things, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel at contemplating these works of <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all amazing things really didn't come from Google.
No, in my opinion, they even didn't come from museums.
Maybe I should not say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital environment does justice to their work of art, and it's represented right online.
And the big question that they do today is this: "You have done this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good afternoon, everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think about it is a <unk> a pixel <unk>
In our lab we call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm from Italian <unk> all the children in Italy grow up with this picture of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that it has happened to be a very interesting thing in the racing racing racing last two decades.
And so some time, if you wanted to win a developmental career, one, take a budget and put it into a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good, you won the career.
This is what it is -- in engineering, we have a control system in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Today what's interesting is that the control systems are starting to go into our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're becoming <unk>
And as <unk> are starting to respond differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is big.
As you can tell, I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the cortex of the planet, but they represent 50 percent of the <unk> population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond the cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition of <unk> <unk> for the last year at MoMA, during the summer time.
His name is called <unk> to <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start <unk>
And in a way, it's like almost all of the existing atoms get <unk>
And that's changing the interaction that as humans have with the outside environment.
In some sense, it's almost like the old <unk> dream.
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> he says that at the end, he took the hammer and he threw it up to the Moses -- you can still see a <unk> <unk> and he said, "You know, <unk> Sean <unk> and that's what not <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a little bit of <unk> <unk> in the idea of getting the environment and push something.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is really one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four years ago in Italy.
It was a summer in 2006.
It was the year that Italy, won the World Cup <unk>
Maybe some of the remember, he played Italy and France, and at the end, he gave the <unk>
And anyway, ultimately I won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at <unk> activity in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the <unk> River.
It's the morning, before the game.
The time line is in the top.
At the late afternoon, there are people here and there and there are <unk>
It starts the <unk> silence.
<unk> in France.
<unk> people make a quick call and go into the bathroom.
Number two: End of time.
First time <unk> a second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
She earns Italy, Italy, yeah!
That night everyone went to <unk>
You see the big summit.
The next day everyone went to the center of the <unk> team and the prime minister then.
And then everybody <unk>
You see the picture of the place called <unk> <unk> where, since the <unk> time, people will go <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how today you can measure the city pulse of the city in a way that we couldn't do a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but of things we use and consume.
Today, we know all about the provenance of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up you know, how do you <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project, we developed some small tags to track the trash in its shift in the system.
We started with some volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little more than a year ago, to tag what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are going to be <unk>
Then we put a little chip, a tag on the garbage and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information, we realized that there is a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that they didn't exist before.
You're going on complicated things, and there's a lot of <unk>
But the other thing that we believe is that if we look at every day that the cup that we <unk> it isn't still somewhere on the planet.
And if the plastic bottle that we cut one day is still still there.
So if we show that to people, then we can promote some change in behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detecting and lots of other great things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part we talked about at the very beginning, which is <unk> on the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago.
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, which came and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of the use of water in public space, in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology do technology -- new technology, join that one?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, on a shop was, imagine they have a <unk> and <unk> valves and <unk> <unk> open and <unk>
It creates like a curtain of water, with pixels in water.
If the pixels can be written in them, show patterns, images texts.
And when we zoom in, the curtain will open up so we can happen, as you see in the image.
We presented this to the mayor of <unk>
He liked it very much.
<unk> a commission to design the building to the input of <unk>
We call it a <unk>
The whole building is made of water.
There is no doors and no windows, but when you come up and open you so that you can happen.
The roof is also covered with water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> you go down the roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears, like in this case.
There will always be someone in the winter, when the roof, go down the roof, someone who was there, and he said, "Let's get the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when it comes down almost all the architecture goes down.
This is how it works.
You see the people who are going on with what happens inside.
And here I'm myself trying to not be able to test the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
All the children in <unk> came to the building because the way to interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that was open to let you go, but a building that was still doing <unk> and black holes and you had to jump to not <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was very interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think of the use that people will give our designs.
But then the reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things that people use.
This is an image of the building with the <unk> the pixels of water, and of projections about them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine those pixels could start to fly.
Imagine that they could have little helicopters in the air and that each one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw before, which is moving with others in synchrony.
We could form this cloud,
A kind of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or in three dimensions, where what it changes is the light, not the position of the pixel position.
You can play it with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen appears in different scales and sizes, in different kinds of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D that you can reach, and see from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form <unk> like earlier.
When the light turns off, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each one of them controlled by one person.
We can have each pixel with an input that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the world's best ballet dancers today, the star of New York City and <unk> <unk> to capture their movement in 3D and use it as input for <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> the <unk>
It's so much 3D <unk> in real time as it capture.
It can be <unk> all the movement.
You can run the whole way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our environment and change our <unk> environment, like a <unk> farm as a <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make it a little bit of a <unk>
And I think what remarkable has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we went from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign, we can go through the digital world, of the <unk> power of networks, to the physical world.
In our case, this might be able to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow it may be to address the challenges of today: think of climate change or CO2 emissions, how to move from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can get people involved in doing this together, in a collective form.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are pixels.
It's a physical structure in London, but I covered the pixel up.
You can move inside, have different experiences.
You can see it from the bottom, to share the main moments of the main Olympics.
So it's so much a physical cloud of the sky as something that you can go up, like a new top of London.
You can go into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is that it will be a new experience for anybody to go to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than what they are.
Suppose I told you that, with just a few changes in your genes, you could improve the <unk> for a more precise, more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you would like to be in a better way, to be stronger.
Would you like to be more attractive and sure of ourselves?
How about good health?
Or maybe these people who always wanted to be more creative.
What is the most important thing you do.
What would you like if you could choose something?
<unk> <unk> <unk>
How many people would <unk> creativity?
Raise your hands. Let me see.
<unk> I probably had the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many people would choose the memory?
A few more.
And the <unk> state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Ah, most of you. That makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have some of this the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe this is possible?
Evolution has been a theme <unk> here at the TED conference but today I want to give you the look of a doctor on the subject.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> who also <unk> in the Church of <unk> <unk> wrote a trial called "Nothing in biology makes sense for the light of <unk>
But if effectively embrace biological evolution consider this: it's just the past, or the future?
Does it mean others or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well on one end, is, of course, the one that interests us.
<unk> of a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
There's been maybe 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some have gone and <unk>
We have been here about <unk> years.
It might seem to be that we're very far away from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in its most of the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can harness and control the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the human insulin protein, which is used to treat the <unk>
This is not like human insulin -- but it's the same protein, it's chemically <unk> from the <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all carry on the most bacteria gut than the cells that we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think of -- when Antonio <unk> you would ask him about the <unk> they think about <unk>
The gut is a beautifully <unk> environment for those bacteria.
It's warm dark, dissolving it's very <unk>
And we're going to give them all the nutrients that can want no effort in their own.
It's really like a quick pathway for bacteria with occasional disruption of some rush <unk> into the output.
But by the other way, we're a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help us digest nutrients nutrients and protect us from certain diseases.
But what do we give us the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or it meant to become something different, something maybe <unk> <unk>
In this vast symphony of <unk> of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, like one and only <unk> and human life, a little bit of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope you've got <unk>
When I first went to college I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental in most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms -- every cell just divide and all the genetic energy of that cell is broadcast to the two daughters.
But when the organisms look like <unk> things start to change.
It goes into the sexual reproduction.
And something very important -- with the emergence of sexual reproduction that happens -- the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you could say that the <unk> of the body death in the same moment of sexual reproduction.
I have to assume that when I was a college student -- I was thinking, well, <unk> <unk> death -- it seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year that was happening, every time I had more <unk>
I came to understand the feelings of George <unk> that still <unk> in Las Vegas well in their 90 years.
And one night someone hits her door to a hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of him is a gorgeous <unk> of clothes.
And he looks at it and he says, <unk> for a <unk> <unk>
She's right." "I choose the <unk>
I realized, as a physician, I was working for a different goal by the goal of <unk> not necessarily just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted to be healthy.
I wanted to get health in the disease.
I wanted us to live more and healthier ways.
Evolution is about moving the genome to the next <unk> adapting and <unk> generation of generation after generation.
From an evolutionary view, you and I are kind of like <unk> rockets designed to send the genetic payload to the next level, and then let us get to the sea.
I think they all <unk> the feeling that Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to make immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> you don't know.
Evolution doesn't necessarily matter about longevity.
It doesn't necessarily serve the greatest or the stronger or the faster they even even the smartest of the smart.
Evolution favors the best adapted to their environment.
That's the only survival test for survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean -- the <unk> bacteria that can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there were fish there, fish in empty fish have managed to make that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what is happening in evolution and if we think about the place of humans in evolution and, in particular, if we look forward to the <unk> phase, I would argue that there are many possibilities.
The first one is that they didn't exist.
We've had a kind of balance.
And the thinking of thinking is that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and separated from the population.
And second of all, as species, we've devised our environment for us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and <unk> so much that it's no longer possible to have the isolation that evolution.
A second possibility is that it is producing an evolution of the traditional traditional type, defined by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And as soon as we <unk> when we sort of <unk> distant planets are going to exist to the isolation, and the environmental changes that can produce evolution in a natural way.
But there's a third possibility, an intriguing and intriguing thing.
I call it the new evolution, the new evolution, which is not just <unk> but <unk> and chosen for us as individuals in the choices that we have.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
First of the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they are choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily a good thing for society, but it's what it chooses to the individual and family level.
Think of also that if you could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to choose not only the sex of your <unk> but in your own body to make the genetic adjustments to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate the <unk>
You wouldn't want to make those changes in your <unk>
If we look at the future that kind of changes is going to be more and more possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 and sued 13 years old.
<unk> million dollars.
In 2004, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome at a cost of 20,000 and a week.
They're not very much for the fact that the human genome will actually make the human genome for <unk> and be getting more and more and more and more and more and more and more and closer to us.
These changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us but they are going to engage against other viruses.
<unk> or there is no experimental trial in the course of the flu vaccine in a tobacco plant.
Can you imagine something good to go out of the <unk>
That's actually today and the future is going to be more and more possible.
Imagine only other two little <unk>
They can change the cells of their bodies but they can change the cells in their <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the newborn egg -- and give your children a better chance of a healthier life, eliminate diabetes to eliminate the risk of cancer?
Who does not want more <unk>
And then, that same <unk> technology that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases is going to allow us to also have to take a better memory of memory.
Why do I not have the ingenuity of <unk> <unk> especially if you could get it with the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why don't you have a faster muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why not live longer.
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions to pass this to the next generation, and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to have become the evolution of before in the <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could take 100,000 years, and we can get it to 1,000 years and maybe happen within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to be in front of them.
We're going to use these options to make a better society, more successful society.
Or, let's pick different attributes that we want for some of us but not for the others?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more robust or more robust and more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the most profound thing about all: we're going to be able to develop the wisdom and to inherit the wisdom needed to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for worse, and before what you could do, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a great explosion when you're at 900 feet high.
Imagine an airplane full of smoke.
Imagine a engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I had a unique seat that day, I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to the flight assistants for the flight.
And so immediately he looked at them, and they said, "There is no problem. You know, you could probably hit some <unk>
The pilot had been <unk> the airplane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot <unk> the airplane with the Hudson River.
And importantly, that's not the road.
It took the motors.
Imagine being on an airplane and no <unk>
And then he said three words.
The three words I had heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to speak more with the flight assistant.
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror. The life was <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before to die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to get and I didn't do it, all the fences I wanted to repair all the experiences that I wanted to have and never come back.
While I was thinking about that later on, I came up with a sentence, which is <unk> wines <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I will open.
I don't want to see anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, really has changed my life.
The second thing that I learned that day -- and this is the way that the bridge George Washington Washington -- which wasn't for much -- I thought about, Whoa! I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes I've tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity also <unk> my ego.
And I am sorry for the time that we were doing with things that didn't care with people that matter.
And I thought about my wife with my wife, with my friends, with the people.
And then, as a <unk> in that, I decided to eliminate the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
Within two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I don't try to have the reason why it is to be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is like your mental clock is going to be <unk> by 14, <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please be <unk>
I don't want this to be broken in 20 pieces like you see in those <unk>
And as I went back, I had the feeling of, Whoa! I'm not afraid.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for that all of our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to love it; I love my life.
And that sadness is <unk> in a single thought, which is, I just want one thing.
I wish I could see my children up.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent -- <unk> --  And I -- and I -- and I -- and I -- and I -- and I -- and I <unk> <unk> like a small boy.
And to me, that was the whole reason to be the world.
At that point I got to connect those two points, that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good parent.
I was given a miracle to not die that day.
And it was given to me another gift, which was the ability to look at the future and go back and live in another way.
You guys are flying up today, the challenge to imagine that the same thing happens on your airplane -- and please don't be like that -- but imagine, and how do you think?
What is it that you think they still expect to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How do you change your relationships and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they are the best parents that <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with a lot of projects.
But the most great thing that I worked was for this guy.
The guy called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s.
One day she came home after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, it has a total paralysis,
You can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design firm and animation, so obviously, graffiti is something intricate that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided we were going to go to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met her brother and her father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and that he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second -- it's not that <unk> seen Stephen <unk> is not that all the people with paralysis, can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you are important and have a very good insurance you can't really do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate then?"
Anybody to see the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They're communicating with the finger, they get <unk>
I said, "That's <unk> How could it be?"
So I came up with the first desire to deliver a check, and rather than it signed a check that I didn't have the least idea of how I was going to <unk>
I love her with his brother and her father there at the very precise time, "All right, this is the <unk> Tony is going to talk, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make her art again.
Because it's ridiculous that somebody who has so much on their inside can't be able to <unk>
So I talked about a conference a couple of months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research <unk> who have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer that they draw on that and record negative space.
So they're going out there making art facilities like this.
All the things that we <unk> they say, are part of a life cycle.
First of them start with sexual organs, then with the bad words, then with the attacks to Bush and the end, people start doing art.
But there was always a life cycle in their <unk>
And so the journey started.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and so much moving the things on one side we had achieved a couple of things.
One, you touch the gates of the insurance companies and we get a machine so that you could make a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And really, it's the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy you get an email from it, and you say, "Don't <unk> This guy is <unk>
The other thing we did was bring seven programmers from all over the <unk> world of all of the corners of the <unk> to our home.
My wife, kids and I, we moved into the back, and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> took control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought that we did something completely stupid and that when they were <unk> they would have taken off the walls of the walls and their place would have <unk>
But for two weeks ago, we went to the <unk> <unk> my son was part of my dog, too, and we created this.
It's called <unk> and you can see the <unk>
They're a pair of sun sun <unk> that we buy in the air of <unk> Beach, some copper wire and <unk> <unk> and Radio <unk>
We took a <unk> camera -- we put it on a light light, and now there's a device that is free -- and it builds up yourself, we published the code, we published the software itself <unk>
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There is no company that says <unk>
There is no hospital that can say <unk>
Any person with paralysis, has access to drawing and communicate using only your eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after about a year of planning, two weeks of programming, about all night, Tony came back to drawing for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful photo because this is the support system, and it's looking through the support system.
We ran the bed so that I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking lot from the hospital.
And he came back to drawing for the first time in front of his family and friends, and you can imagine, what was the feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to take in the parking lot, so we feel like we were <unk> graffiti as well.
At the end of this, he sent us an email and this was what he said, "This was the first time I was drawing in seven years.
I felt like it had been under the water and someone finally came to <unk> and they would get me out there so that I could be able to get it out.
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our scream for war.
That's what keeps us in motion.
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a very cool device, but it's the equivalent of a <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So that's why we're trying to figure out how to go and make it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've gained many awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us is making money with this.
All of our own pockets.
The prizes were <unk> "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us and then, in December, and Time magazine recognized us as one of the 50 better inventions of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends up to close the <unk> is that in April of this year in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> downtown Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> they're all going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show, which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: if you see something that is not possible, do it possible.
None of the stuff that there is in this room was possible -- scenario, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at some time.
Do you know anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> recognition technology -- I just recognized something and I was fascinated with wonderful people to make it happen.
And these are the questions I want us to do all the days when we find something that we feel like to do with something that we feel like to do.
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years in the last few years in situations very difficult and at the same time a dangerous time.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a <unk> mine.
If you go into <unk> areas and dangerous areas.
And I spent 30 days of eating just this fun -- a lot of fun -- a very dangerous thing in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career I've been focusing on situations in horrible appearance with the only goal of trying to examine social issues in ways that <unk> attractive, interesting, and, hopefully analyzing them in a way that they see cool and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew that I would come here to do a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit different.
So some of you may have heard about it, or not, a couple of weeks ago I took an <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I volunteered to sell the rights of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What was the following. It was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk in which you have no idea what it is and as a piece of content that is about it, and according to content could be <unk> in the face, especially if I put it <unk> to you or your company to do it.
But that said this, it's a very good opportunity to be <unk>
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights.
If you would have asked me a year ago, I hadn't been able to do it for certain.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we looked at the <unk> <unk>
And as I said earlier, I've gotten myself in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could get me wrong, for something so difficult or so dangerous to enter the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to make a film that tries to deal with the <unk> of products, the marketing and the <unk> and that all the film is <unk> with <unk> products, marketing and advertising.
The movie is going to be called "The largest film ever <unk>
What happens in "The largest film ever <unk> is that all of the top up to the bottom of the end, it has images of brand, all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title of the title, the <unk>
Now this brand, we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea -- <unk> <unk> is <unk> That's what?
I am a <unk> <unk> <unk> Only <unk> It was more for <unk>
He was <unk> <unk>
But we're not only going to have the speed of the X marks in the title -- but we're going to make sure that we would give all the categories that we can on the film.
You might take a shoe and you get the most great shoe that you had <unk>
The most cool car that you've driven in "The largest film ever had ever been <unk> the best drinking you've had <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then in addition to showing the brands as a part of the life, making them <unk> <unk> to make it <unk> -- MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the whole film is transparency.
You're going to see all the process in this movie.
That's the whole idea, all the shot of the beginning of beginning to end.
And I would love to be able to help make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that is the most respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how <unk> it's going to be people to that.
<unk> You have a <unk> I don't know if you're <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> Not <unk> How much money does it need to do this?
MS: One and a half million <unk> <unk> <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be hard to the meeting with them, but it certainly is going to be worth to convince a couple of big <unk>
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the film came out, we see it as a lot of idiots <unk>
MS: What do you think that's going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be <unk>
MS: But it will be hard to <unk> for the film or to be I?
JK:
MS: ... means you're not very optimistic.
So I <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. That's the <unk> When you look at the people that you need to be <unk>
MK: We have some places to go, <unk> <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: And I thought that <unk> meant we have a conversation outside the microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one by one, all these companies were suddenly gone.
No one wanted to have anything to do with this movie.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought that the concept of advertising, was to present the product to as many people as possible, to make that as many people see it as possible.
Especially in the world today, this intersection of new media and old media scenario and the scenario of the separate media, is not the idea to count with that new vehicle worthy vehicle that's going to lead the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a <unk> mistake and that mistake was this.
No, no, there was no such mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been okay.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for images of <unk> on Google <unk>   -- this is one of the first images that were introduced.
I like your <unk>
This is the problem: the <unk> <unk> of simulation or <unk> easily detected or <unk> <unk> that is characterized by the visibility or access of information, especially in the practices practices -- the last line probably the largest problem.
You see, we hear a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president -- even the CEOs <unk>
But all of a sudden when it comes to make it really changes suddenly.
But why? Well, the transparency gives <unk>  like that <unk> bear still <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this weird rural path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
We took a whole <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and to tell you that we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want me to say, <unk> story.
We want it to make a story, but we want to make it happen.
You see, when I was a kid, and my father stood up to me in some lie -- and that's him looking at me as I used to say, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
There's your story, and it's my story, and it's the <unk> history.
As you can see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a agency wanted to help me -- and that only because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized I would have to go through my account, I would have to take off the <unk> and go to the companies I have all my team.
So what I started to look at all of a sudden -- and I started to give myself a question -- is that when you start talking to the companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big films and big, giants and others who make small, independent movies, like mine.
And my friends who make Hollywood Hollywood movies say that the reason their movies are so successful is due to the brands that they have.
And then my friends who make independent movies say, "Well, how are we supposed to be competing with these big, giant movies <unk>
And the film is called "The largest film ever <unk>
How are we going to see <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say "Are you good for this <unk>
You're ready? You see a little bit nervous.
I want to help you to get up.
Maybe you should put you a little bit before the <unk>
And there was one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> will have their opportunity.
We're going to have a lot of a man as a <unk> solid, to <unk> it in bar, whatever.
That's the general.
Now I can answer their questions and give them a <unk>
Karen Frank: We're a small brand.
<unk> the kind of smaller movies that we <unk> we are more <unk>
So we don't have the budget that has other brands.
So do things like that, you know, remind you to remind people is why this interests us.
MS: What words would use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a great question.
<unk> <unk>
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talked about something bold <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and the <unk>
It keeps you <unk>
How do we keep them cool longer. With better <unk> -- three times more <unk>
Things like those that are <unk>
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What is the common kind of <unk>
I need to talk to the man of the street, the people like me, the ordinary <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like the good <unk>
Woman: It revive the '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, well, what is the brand <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of dark colors, a lot of gray colors, and things like that.
Usually I take accessories like <unk> or the <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand a brand could be a <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I would call it <unk>
Woman 2: Part of <unk> partly <unk> in part of <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the guy in the pets.
They <unk> toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my <unk>
In my little sector, that's my <unk>
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because they would say, <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk> <unk>
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be able to be an Tom, but I would often believe it at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the photos, right?
MS: Yeah. The first photo is a family picture.
A: Tell me a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings your way to be.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: Tell me that world.
MS: That <unk> I think that your world is the world in which you think about the people around you, your friends, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come from, and they start in a place and in my case, and they start in my family, in Virginia Virginia.
A: What's the next one you want to <unk>
MS: The next one is "This was the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who would like to be me.
I like the different things.
I like the rare things, I like the weird things.
A: Tell me the <unk> to what does that look like?
What is the <unk> What a <unk> phase are you know?
Why is it important to <unk> What does the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
It's a little more like you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You don't have to be scared, what kind of Russian mountain are you?
MS: <unk> Thank you.) No, thank you.
A: thank you for your patience. You know, Britain.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what is going to come out of this.
There was a lot of crazy <unk>
<unk> <unk> The first thing that I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but it was <unk> in your personality of <unk> <unk> Morgan <unk> is a <unk> brand.
They get very good together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I believe that some companies are only influenced by one of their strong points or in the other rather than focus on both.
A lot of companies tend -- and it's the <unk> nature of the things that are not <unk> they avoid fear, those items, and you actually have to sink and make you become a positive thing for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are this?
The first here is the classic <unk>
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> <unk> and brands -- those things that have gone and come on, but a <unk> brand is quite powerful.
MS: A <unk> <unk> What's your <unk>
If someone asks you to take your identity, your <unk> identity, what would that be?
You're a <unk>
Or are you more kind of a <unk>
A little more <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are like being playful -- being cool like <unk> contemporary and bold or audacious like <unk> <unk> quickly or <unk> <unk> dominant, a dominant, mystical or mystical <unk>
Or are you rather than attribute <unk>
You're conscious, <unk>
You're <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You are <unk> soft, safe, sacred sacred, <unk> sacred sacred, like the Dalai Lama or <unk>
In the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they wouldn't have control, they would have no control over the end product.
We allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this film, how do we now use MRI to identify the magnetic resonance centers, both for commercial marketing as a film.
We went to San Paulo where they've banned advertising <unk>
In the entire city for the last five years, there is no <unk> no <unk> no <unk>
And we went to school districts where companies are getting the way into the schools with the problems in the U.S.
The incredible thing to me is that projects where I've had the most successful response or what I've had most success is the ones I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> <unk> took their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies have no interest in mind.
I'm going to try directly with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to make people thinking about people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And what has he gone? They didn't look smart.
Well, since the movie was released in the <unk> Festival <unk> let's take a look.
According to <unk> the film was released in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions of the media for this film.
This is just a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> or press, and TV.
The film is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It hasn't even been presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has started to make momentum.
And it's not wrong because it's almost all of the agencies that we talk about to love their clients not to be a part.
I've always believed that if you take risks, if you take risks that in those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you get to the people of that is pushing it to failure.
I think when you train your employees on the loss <unk> it's preparing your entire company for <unk>
I feel that what it has to happen to now is that we need to encourage people to <unk>
We need to animate the people who are not afraid of the opportunities that can be <unk>
Ultimately, we'll go forward, I think we need to turn it to fear.
We need to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear of risk.
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace the peril.
And ultimately, we have to harbor transparency.
More than ever a little bit of honesty is going to go a long way.
And that said this, with honesty and transparency, all my talk -- the <unk> has been presented by my good friends from <unk> who for <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in big opportunities for companies from the world.
<unk> presents <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So I had June Cohen: So <unk> in the name of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check at the name of the TED Lab, the <unk> Foundation, and a check for <unk> to be applied to my assistance to the next year.
The idea behind the Gordian worm is very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their greatest active to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant.
The gray boxes that you see are control systems in real time.
If we managed to compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with <unk>
The gray boxes don't use software from <unk> are a completely different technology.
But if we can put a cash cash virus in a portable computer that was used by an engineer to set up this gray, gray, then we're ready.
This is the plan.
We started with an Windows.
The <unk> enters the gray, box, <unk> the <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, yeah?
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started to research on <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing I knew is that it's very, very complex in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It seemed like to do something with these <unk> <unk> these control systems.
And that struck us the attention, and we started an experiment in which we were looking at our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened with this.
So they had very strange things.
<unk> <unk> like a lab in the lab that didn't like our <unk> I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense of me.
And then to experience with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, this is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is looking for active in the gray box if it finds a specific configuration, and even if the program that is trying to infect it's actually working on that place.
If not, <unk> does nothing.
So that struck my attention -- and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what the <unk> is.
It could be, let's say for example, a power plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better than <unk> the goal soon.
And so we came and pulled the attack code, and we found that it was <unk> in two bombs a small and a big one.
We also saw that they were very professionally <unk> by people who obviously had all the internal information there.
They took all the points for those to attack.
You probably even know how much it was <unk> the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex and high technology, let me say, the payload is very complex.
It's very above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code.
We're talking about 15 billion code.
It looks like the old <unk> language.
I want to tell you how we could find that code.
What we were looking at at the beginning was called to function functions, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking at <unk> and data structures, and we tried to push them with the real world, with the goals of the real world.
We need an theories about meanings that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals -- we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it has to be a <unk> <unk> it has to be <unk> in Iran, because it's where most infection has been <unk>
You don't find several thousand goals in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and the <unk> plant.
So I said to my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and energy plants among our <unk>
I called them and I went into an effort for <unk> his experience with what we found on code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
<unk> is that part of a mobile part, that black object you see.
If you run the speed of this <unk> you can certainly <unk> and even make it <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in an effort to <unk> the nest engineers so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We tried to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very close to the data and their structures.
So for example, the <unk> number is <unk> on that code, you can't afford it.
I started scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and I found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and each waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That had sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what do we find on the code of <unk>
A pretty <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in the hands.
So it wasn't like that, it wasn't like this.
The results have been coming after several weeks of hard work.
And we had <unk> <unk> and we had to go back again.
Yet, we found that both digital <unk> would report to one single goal, but from different perspectives.
<unk> is taking a <unk> and making the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> it communicates with six water and manipulating it.
In <unk> we're very confident that we've determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We must not worry about the other goals that are <unk> by <unk>
Here I show you some very interesting things that we saw -- I really miss me.
There's the gray box and the top you see the <unk>
What this thing does is <unk> the input values of sensors -- for example, of the sensors of pressure and the pattern of vibration and provide code, which still runs during attack, with false password data.
And believe it or not, these false entry data are <unk> by <unk>
It's like the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera feeds on video <unk>
It's <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> the operators in the fourth control.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a power plant, when the big steam turbine goes away from the speed, you have to open escape from <unk>
Obviously, this can't make it a human operator, though.
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they're <unk> then they can pass bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And not the <unk> nor the security system is <unk>
That scares that.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically with <unk> with <unk>
It could work also, for example, in a power plant, or in a <unk>
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> that disseminate this burden with a <unk> key, as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional <unk> technology for <unk>
It would be the most possible.
And if you made that, with what you're going to do, is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we have to face.
Unfortunately, the largest goals of goals is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and Japan.
All the green areas are in large numbers of goals.
We need to deal with the implications, and better than we start doing now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public in many sides that people assume that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, really want to hear this?
Yeah.
My guess is that <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the Lazarus superpower, for this.
There's one alone and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because, in another way, our problems would be even older.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that you can take and give it <unk> abilities or others to make any chairs on wheels and get a walk.
In <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
It's nothing different from something that you put in the morning, gives you a great force -- which is also increasing its speed, and aid, for example, to manage the balance.
It's actually the real integration of the man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate and connect with the universe and with other things that are <unk>
This is not an idea.
And so to show you now what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, has to take on their back a <unk> load of 45 pounds, and it is <unk> it will lead even more equipment.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- injuries on your back, in 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic <unk>
We decided to contemplate this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help deal with the issue.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> <unk> Human wisdom.
Soldier: With the <unk> exoskeleton I can put it up, 90 pounds per extra terrain for many hours.
Their flexible design, it allows you to get into <unk> <unk> and run with great <unk>
I want to do what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my force and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
Let's go back now to the users of iron chairs on what I feel particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people roughly, in the <unk> around the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens with very often, very young people in the spinal cord that when they start their life -- to the 20, 30 or 40 years -- <unk> against a wall and the wheelchair is their only choice.
We also talk about the population that is getting very quickly.
His only option, many times -- for a brain injury, or some other complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been so over the last 500 years, from its successful <unk> as I must recognize.
So we decided to start writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who spent 19 years ago had an injury in the neocortical column, and as a result was unable to go back 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It's got sensors ...
It didn't have been <unk> on the crutches that send signals to board, here on the back.
There is a few batteries that give the motors to the motors in the knees, and the knees, and they do it with this soft and very natural ride.
AB: I had 24 years at the top of my life when, for a strange jump in the air, skiing down the bottom <unk>
At a fraction of a second, I lost all feeling and all the movement of <unk>
Shortly after, a doctor went into my room at the hospital, and he said, <unk> never going to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So stole it to the last bit of hope of my self.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn how to <unk> it costs the <unk> and even flying <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, until now.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change the life of future generations -- not only from soldiers, but to Amanda, and all the users of <unk> all of all of the <unk>
AB: Thank you.
I just come back from a community that has the secret to human survival.
It's a place where women have the <unk> practice sex to say hello, and the game is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the New York festival.
Ladies and gentlemen, you know about your cousins.
This is the world of the wild Bonobos in the rainforests of Congo.
The Bonobos are next to the chimpanzees, their living relatives <unk>
That means that we all share a common ancestor, a evolutionary grandmother who lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've done too much emphasis on this thing in our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by big, <unk> society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a very tolerant society, where the death violence is still not implemented.
But unfortunately, the Bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the forest <unk> and it's been very difficult to <unk>
The Congo is a <unk> an Earth of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> scenario of a violent conflict that has been generated by decades, and caused almost as many deaths like the First World War.
It's no wonder that this destruction also puts in danger the survival of the Bonobo.
The trade of hunting and deforestation can not fill up or a stadium with the Bonobos who are in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure of it.
However, in this land of violence and <unk> you can hear the <unk> hidden <unk> the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them like the ape ape -- love, not <unk> because they have <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to manage conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of the Bonobos is more than <unk> <unk>
At <unk> like humans, they love to play all their life.
Play is not just a child's game.
And for us, the game is fundamental to establish bonds and foster <unk>
With him we learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of the game.
The game increases creativity and resilience and it has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity diversity of interactions, diversity diversity of connections.
And when you look at the game Bonobo sees the same <unk> roots of laughter, the dance and the <unk>
The game is the glue that came to us.
I don't know how you play you, but I want to show you a couple unique unique videos of the wild.
First of all, it's a <unk> game game and I'm not talking about soccer.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look what she is doing it.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, "I have <unk>
Just that I think in this case, he love, right?
Yes.
So sexual game is common both in Bonobos as in humans.
And this video really is interesting because it shows this video really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing these unusual elements into the game, like the <unk> and also how the game requires trust and promotes the <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can take many ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> perhaps the place where the wonder.
And I want you to say, this is <unk> a young female who is playing with a fresh water.
I think that, like that, sometimes we play alone, and we explored the limits of our inner worlds.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just little samples of the understanding that Bonobos give us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret to our future, a future in which we have to adapt to a increasingly difficult world with greater creativity and more cooperation.
The secret is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk>
To adapt it to a world that changes we have to play.
But let's focus on the most our ability of game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is critical.
For Bonobos and humans, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it seems like the least appropriate to play, you can be the most <unk>
So fellow primates, let's accept this gift of evolution and play together as they <unk> creativity, the friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York City, I'm responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I am not fighting poverty, they were <unk> <unk> as a captain of the storm in a storm <unk> volunteers.
And in our city, where the volunteers tend to make a highly skilled staff, you have to get to the fire site very soon to go into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high chance to go.
But there was a race on the foot against the other volunteers to get the captain in charge and figure out what our task was.
When I found <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were at the middle of the night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in his pajamas <unk> while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer I had just got to get before me, <unk> <unk> <unk>  came back first to the captain and he asked him to go and save the dog <unk>
<unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money that, for the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people who entered a <unk> building to save a living live just because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to stand at the house.
I need you to <unk> <unk> fire, and bring this woman a pair of shoes."
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I expected but <unk> I got the stairs, at the end of the hall, I went down to the firemen <unk> that the more or less had ended up on the fire and entered the main room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
And I took my burden on the staircase where I met my <unk> and the lovely dog on the front door.
<unk> from the house the treasures for the home owner where, as I was waiting for, his treasure. received a lot more attention than mine.
A few weeks later the department received a letter from the owner of <unk> <unk> for the brave <unk> effort to save his house.
The kindness that she looked at for about the other was that somebody had reached a pair of shoes.
Both of my calling at Robin <unk> like in my calling as a voluntary firefighter that I'm witness as acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also as acts of grace and courage to individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
It all has its importance.
So when I look at this room with people who've made it, or they're for <unk> remarkable levels of success I would like to remind you to remind you about this.
Don't wait to win the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give you a little bit now.
They took food in a dining room, a neighborhood park in the neighborhood.
Is it mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save someone else's lives, but each day we're going to be able to influence somebody's life.
So they trained the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, it comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first concrete blocks of concrete are built in <unk> with a very simple idea, modules of concrete as fixed as it fit together.
Very quickly, these became the most used unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build things bigger than us, like buildings or bridges or a brick at a time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, to <unk> we came up with this.
It was called <unk>
And in a few years, the <unk> bricks came to all the homes.
It's estimated that you have made over 400 billion or 75 bricks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer, to build beautiful or buildings or homes.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the molecular block -- the favorite in the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of <unk> bricks to each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete block, the transistor allows you to create a lot more complex and more complex circuits a brick at a time.
But there's a <unk> difference -- the transistor was only for experts.
I personally don't know that the building blocks of our time are reserved for the experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started to explore the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are all the electronics each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is that they put together through magnets together.
So you can't get the wrong way.
<unk> have a code in color.
The green is the fence, the blue is the stream, the rose is the input and the orange color is <unk>
So there's only one to assemble a blue with one green and very quickly you can start to make bigger circuits.
A blue with one green produces light.
Can we put a button in the environment, so we have a <unk>
If we change the button for a pulse of pulse that's here, and now we have a light <unk>
We put this <unk> to create more impact, and we have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are really powerful.
Instead of having a program, connect and <unk> <unk> it allows us to program using very simple <unk>
To make <unk> faster or slow, just turn this button to make the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's an increasing collection.
We want all of the interactions in the world to build ready to use.
<unk> sounds, solar panels, all must be accessible.
We've given <unk> to the children to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how you start to understand the electronics of every day you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a light of night, or why the door of an elevator you keep open or how an iPod responds to touch.
We have also led to design schools.
So for example, designers without expertise in electronics start playing with <unk> like a material.
You can see here with bottles of paper and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
So a few weeks ago --  -- a few weeks ago we took the designer from the Rhode Island School of Island, who don't have expertise in engineering, just in cardboard, and wood and <unk> and we said, do something.
Here's an example of a project that you've done, a <unk> canyon <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> made of <unk> which has a fear of darkness.
For these not engineers, <unk> it became another material, electronic electronics became another material.
And we want this material to all of us.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, download all the files of design and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world we live, this interactive world, is ours.
So ahead and <unk>
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you about the unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology industry.
And my little company is looking for engaging with the environment.
The distributed collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait for a moment.
You can take a little bit of <unk>
We can continue to better leave the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology.
Oh, you know about time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that's supposed to work in government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like a bunch of Peace <unk>
We took some members every year and we put them working with the <unk>
Instead of sending them to the Third World and we send it to the wild world.
They did great <unk> they worked with the <unk>
Your task is to show the possibilities of technology today.
Let me <unk>
It's a flood of the city in Boston.
Here it appears as if I would look at a quote, but what really looks for is someone who gets caught in the snow because he knows it's not very good at turning fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it get to ask for help for this very <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and that moment was very much last year.
They realized that the city never wiped these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> noticed something else -- that citizens would have <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them.
So it did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application in which you can embrace a <unk>
You accept <unk> when you <unk>
When you do that, you put a name, in this case, put it <unk>
If you don't do it, someone can be <unk>
So it has a component uprising.
It's a modest app.
Maybe it's the smallest of the 21 applications -- last year.
But it does something that no other technology of the Afghan government.
And it spreads on viral.
An responsible for the city of <unk> <unk> to see this app realized that I could use it not for the snow, but for the citizens to have <unk> <unk>
It's very important that they work these <unk> of tsunami, but people steals the batteries.
And so he asks the citizens that <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago has just been <unk> to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that we use using it.
And this has been <unk> <unk> in a natural way.
If you know a little government technology, you know that it doesn't happen yet.
The software acquisition is usually a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for the parents to choose the best public school for their children.
And then they told us that they had done it for normal channels would have led to the least two years and cost about two million dollars.
And that's not nothing.
Now there's a project in the power of California that all the way over 2,000 million dollars, and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this on every level of government.
So an app that comes in a couple of days, and it spreads in viral forms is a kind of shot from warning to the institution of government.
It suggests the best ways to work, not as in private companies as many people think that should be.
Not as a technological company, but rather as the Internet itself.
I mean, <unk> <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this application is that it represents the way to address the question of the government that has the new <unk> not like a problem of an institution, but as a collective action problem.
And that's very good because it turns out that we are very good for collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools to be able to engage together with efficacy.
And not only is it <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people all over the country that contribute to applications that make applications in their own communities.
They haven't been given to the government.
They feel a great frustration before that, but they didn't get rid of it.
And these people know something we've lost in sight.
And that is that if we leave the feelings about politics, the row in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all those other things that we get crazy -- the government is, essentially, in the words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because we alone didn't exist.
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
<unk> not <unk> the government yes.
And because the government ultimately <unk> out of us -- remember that <unk> the <unk> The way to think about it will affect the way that change.
I didn't know a lot about government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought that the government was to choose people to make them <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that government is about everything, about <unk>
This is the heart of mobile phone care center.
It's the place that serves the calls if you mark yourself in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this call.
He entered <unk> on the official <unk> base.
I didn't find any. It started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the gates of the house, put it very hard and see if you <unk>
And it worked. So it worked.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a call center.
It has a <unk> web and mobile <unk> called <unk>
They didn't get that app.
It was the work of people very smart people from the Bureau of New York City <unk>
One day, this was really, really got this <unk> <unk> in my bucket of trash.
How do I do it for <unk>
<unk> dynamics are different.
Scott was talking to a person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so everyone can see this.
In this case, he saw a neighbor.
The next report, he said, <unk> <unk> I found the bucket of garbage behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
He turned the <unk> I went home.
Good nights, <unk> <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of the digital and <unk>
And it's also a great example of the income of the government to the distributed volunteer collaboration.
But it's also a big example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of platform.
I'm talking about a platform for the people to get sick and help others.
So, a citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
It connected the two people.
And it could have been connected with the government services of being necessary but the neighbor is a better and cheaper than the government services.
When a neighbor helps another, we would save the communities.
If we call animal control, that costs a lot of money.
An important thing we have to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people do it, but think it's the entrance to the other.
What our input to the government system is <unk>
How many times have they chosen a political <unk> sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government will prescribe our values and we need our needs, but we don't see changes.
That is because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the shallow <unk>
It's what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it is that <unk> which holds us into that that we essentially belongs to that that we essentially belongs to our against, that other thing, and as a result, we're losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work, we'll have to make bureaucracy to be sexy.
Because it's where the real work of government occurs.
We need to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the movement <unk>
You've got them <unk>
It's a bunch of citizens concerned that have written a very detailed report of 325 pages of 325 pages in response to the financial reform project on the financial reform project.
That's not political activism is activism <unk>
And for the ones that we've asked ourselves to the government, it's time to ask ourselves, what world do we want to leave our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that we face.
Do you really believe that we have to go where we have to go without solving the institution that can act on <unk>
We can't tax government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the root function so that it can be expansion to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows it's not so difficult to act <unk> just that we have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old, so I am, <unk> I'm a bigger generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to <unk> everyone will talk.
They can express their opinions in any channel at the same time and they do.
So when you face the government problem doesn't matter so much to do hear your voices.
They're using their hands.
They are able to do the work for programming applications that make the government better.
And those applications allow us to use their hands to improve our communities.
It may be cleaning up a <unk> out of it, taking out a bucket of garbage that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we could always have cleaned up those <unk> and a lot of people do.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, we're not only consumers of government that we pay taxes and we get services.
We are more than that; we are citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't get rid of it.
So I want to ask all of you, when it comes to the important things we have to do together, all together, we will be a swarm of voices, or we'll be able to be a swarm of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in the prisons, prisons and the death.
I've spent most of my life in communities and projects where there is a lot of despair.
And I'll be here at TED seeing and hearing these <unk> has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that they say here is impact around the world.
Sometimes if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that would not have any other way.
I say this because I think identity is important.
Here we've seen fantastic <unk>
And I think that we have learned that the words of a teacher may have a lot of sense, but if they teach them feeling they can have special meaning to feel about.
A doctor can do things like good things, if it's <unk> it can get a lot more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't actually learn this in the practice of law, my work.
I learned from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional family house, dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard was strong, he had power.
It was the last word in all discussion in the family.
She <unk> a lot of <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
Her parents were born in slavery in Virginia on <unk>
She was born about the <unk> and his experience with the slavery <unk> the way the world saw the world.
She was hard but it was also <unk>
When I was a little bit and looked at it, she was approaching me and giving me a good hug.
I was so hard that I could barely breathe and then let me angry.
One or two hours later, I went back to <unk> and he was approaching me, <unk> still feeling my <unk>
And if I said no, I would get me back again and I would say yes, I was left in peace.
He had this human quality that would always wish you to be near it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the least 10.
Sometimes when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to get his time and her attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
I thought it was a game.
And so I looked at him and she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she got up and went through the room, I took my hand down, and he said, "Come on. The two we're going to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
He took me outside and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't tell you."
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "Now I didn't get it; I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, I looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you want.
I'll never forget it.
And then he said, "I just want you to get me back three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "What first I want you to tell me, is that you always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to make sure the <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
And then he said, "The second I want you to tell me, is that you are always going to do the right thing -- although the right thing to do it.
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk> That's how we <unk>
And then he finally said, "The third thing I want you to tell me, is that I never read <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
I grew up in the field, in the South Side -- I have an elder year and one sister a year.
When I was 14 or 15, one day my brother came home with a six <unk> package I don't know where the <unk> grabbed my sister and I went into the forest.
We just arrived doing the <unk>
He took a drink of beer, she offered my sister, she took a little bit and he was offered to me.
And I said, "No, no, no. You know, I'm going to ask you, but I'm not going to take you."
My brother said, <unk> today -- and you always do the same thing that we do.
I already took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good, you can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What's going on? Take a <unk>
And I went on the eyes with force and <unk> "Oh, not that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that I probably should not say.
I know this is spreading <unk>
But I have 52 years and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I'm not saying this is a <unk> I mean by the power that identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to others who don't really make any sense.
We can't get them to do things that they don't believe power.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner for <unk>
My whooping died of age-related disease?
And these were the things that we had to do with it, we had to take care of it.
Now, I'll try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different today than it was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There's 2.3 million.
In the United States we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this massive incarceration, in my view, has changed our world.
In poor communities or black, it's so much <unk> so much despair, by these facts.
One in three black <unk> between 18 and 30 years is in jail or <unk>
In urban <unk> all over the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore Washington Washington from all the young people in color are in jail or <unk>
Our system is not just distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a judicial system that makes you much better if you're rich and <unk> than if you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> but wealth that affects the results of the results.
And it seems that we feel very <unk>
The politics of fear and anger makes us believe that these are not problems with ours.
We're <unk>
I think it seems interesting.
We're looking at our work some developments very well.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as in other states, they give you the rights as always if you have a criminal <unk>
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of black male population has lost the right to vote.
And if we put it over the next 10 years the loss of rights loss will be as high as it was before it was before the law of the right to vote.
We have this awesome silence.
I represent children.
Many of my clients are very young.
The United States is the only country in the world where the child was in 13 years to die in prison.
We have in this country jail for children, no possibility to come out.
Right now, we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
Tell people in the death corridor of death.
This issue of death row is interesting.
In a certain sense, you've got to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by the <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another way of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die by crime crimes but if we deserve to kill them.
This is interesting.
The death penalty in the United States is defined by mistake.
In every nine persons <unk> people have identified one which is innocent and he released from the death corridor of death.
A <unk> rate, an innocent in every nine.
This is interesting.
And in aviation it would not be allowed to ever fly planes if in every nine that <unk> one would be <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of if we deserve to kill them.
It's interesting that in my classes with students on <unk> history, I talk about slavery.
I talk about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the rebuilding and that lasted to the Second World War.
We really don't know a lot about this.
But for black Americans in this country, it was very defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid of being <unk>
They were worried about being <unk>
The threat of terror was what defined their lives.
Now there are people older people who come to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you tell me about the people who stop saying that in our history we deal with terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No, we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went on, obviously, with segregation and decades of that racial and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All of the time we would get to each other.
We constantly create tensions and conflict.
It costs us to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage you with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they couldn't overcome <unk> and race without a compromise with the truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving lectures on the death row.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "Do you know that it's good to listen to what you're going to do.
<unk> "We have no death penalty in Germany.
We will never be able to be here."
The room was quiet and a lady said, "There is no way that we have our history, we can never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational to us, <unk> and <unk> we put us to run people."
So let's get it on this.
How do we feel in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were in their majority <unk>
We couldn't afford it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there's this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If you really don't care about these hard issues, the positive things and wonderful they are, though, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated with technology. We understand creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> by suffering, abuse, abuse, <unk>
In my opinion, you need to integrate both things.
We're talking about the need for the need to have more hope, more engagement with the basic challenges of the life of this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> the ones that never come to TED.
Think of them is, in a way, something that is inside our being.
We really need to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. In spite of being so rational, so deeply committed to the intellectual,
With innovation, the development of creativity is not just about brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas, also by the convictions of the heart.
This kind of connection to the heart is what drives us to look at not only bright and <unk> but also in the dark and hard.
<unk> <unk> the great leader was talking about this.
He said, "When we were in Eastern Europe, suffering from <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but primarily what we needed was hope, orientation for the spirit, a will for being in despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is practically at the heart of what I think even in communities like TED, should be <unk>
There is no disconnect related to the technology and design, which allowed us to be truly human, if we don't take care of the attention to poverty, to <unk> inequality to injustice.
Now I want to tell you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we ignored these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, being a very young lawyer -- to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were just getting together to talk.
Occasionally, lady was called to me, and they go, <unk> comes the <unk>
You want to come and <unk>
I said, "Be lady. I know so."
So she said, "Well, what are you going to do when you <unk>
I read <unk>
And so I was going and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And at one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple hours, Ms. Parks came to me and said, "Now, <unk> me tell me that this idea of justice justice.
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started giving me my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been doomed to <unk>
We try to confront the biases and discrimination in the management of criminal justice.
We try to end up with the <unk> for life, no freedom for children.
We try to do something about the death row.
We try to reduce the population in prison.
We try to end up with the <unk> <unk>
I gave it all my best speech and at the end of the end of me and he looked at me and said, "Hey, <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
At that point, Mrs. <unk> got a finger on the face, and he said, "It's why you have to be very much, but very <unk>
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to figure out how to deal with those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally, humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I have come to understand and believe that each one of us is higher than the worse that we have <unk>
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't love you, it's not that it's a <unk>
Even if someone kills another one, it's not that it's a <unk>
So I think there's a basic dignity in the people who must be <unk> by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and, surely, in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
That's right.
I really think that in many parts of poverty is the justice.
And finally, I think that even though it's very <unk> very beautiful, very <unk> that we don't judge us for our technology, for our designs, and our intellectual ability or rational.
At the end of the way, the character of a society, not by the way they deal with powerful rich, powerful and <unk> but by the way they treat the poor, the <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand really profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to finish with a story.
Sometimes I do too much power.
<unk> tired, like everybody.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in an important way.
I've been representing these guys that have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my clients in 13 and 14 years old, which have been <unk> so that they were paying adults as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn someone in what it isn't it?
He knew it as an adult, but I see a kid.
A late night I was wake up <unk> by God, if the judge can turn you into something that you cannot have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magic powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As it was very late, I couldn't think right, but I started working on a <unk>
He had a 14 year-old customer -- black.
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> so that my <unk> black customer is treated as a <unk> white <unk> executive from a <unk>
In the <unk> I set up there were there have been <unk> behavior, in the <unk> of the police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethics, but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really <unk>
For my horror, I was not just <unk> it was sent to court.
It took about two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally <unk> Oh my God, I have to go to the court for this case.
I got on the car and I was really <unk> <unk>
I went into the car camp.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally came down the car. He walked to court.
I was going up the stairs when I came up with a black man who was <unk> was the court.
When he saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> he said, "It's <unk> I said yes.
And so I walked up and I was shocked.
And I was standing on the ear,
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that it was <unk>
That is deeply connected with my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the <unk>
When I came in, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this bold <unk>
I said, "Be Mr. <unk> I did."
People started there. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
They got the cops the prosecutors <unk> <unk> <unk>
Suddenly, without knowing how, the room was full of people -- everyone is married, because we talked about races, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye, I got to see the <unk> which was going to be <unk>
He was looking for the window and they were able to hear all that <unk>
You spend walking over here and there.
Finally, this old black <unk> I entered the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the Justice <unk> a <unk>
During the break for a <unk> assistant he showed up, because the <unk> had entered the room.
The assistant.
And he said, "Well, what do you do in the <unk> hall.
And the old black guy stood up and looked at the <unk> and he looked at me and he said, "Let's go to this <unk> room to tell this young man who keeps his view on the goal with <unk>
I have come today to TED because I think many of you realize that the moral moral of the universe is very big, but it folds toward justice.
What we can't be truly human humans, if we don't care about human rights, and for dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
What our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must be <unk> by <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, to those of us who share this, I just want to tell you that keep the view in the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: Tell me to hear and see a clear of the audience of this community, to help in your purposes of doing something.
One is not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities close to us.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring, which is going to be an effort to save the funds that are spending today in punishment policy.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars on death row, in the next five years, a billion dollars.
And in spite of this, the <unk> of the cases in homicide didn't grow in <unk>
The <unk> of the rapes do nothing.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to come up with these funds to get the law to get the law to the security.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in the <unk> in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it says that it has to do with the largest <unk> rate.
What would you say to what you think is this?
<unk> Actually, the <unk> rate of violence has remained relatively stable.
The great growth in mass <unk> in this country is not by crime with violence.
It's the wrong war against drugs.
That's why this dramatic rise in the <unk> population.
And we let us convince us for the rhetoric of punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to supply chain to rob a bicycle, for small crimes against the property, rather than making those resources to their victims.
I think we need to make the victims of the <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy about punishment does nothing for anyone.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> have you excited about <unk> today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.
<unk> <unk> threats by Bin Laden's death.

Oh, my God.
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips that I got in the last six months, <unk> could be in the last six days or over the last six years.
The idea is that media media would prefer <unk> negative news because our minds pay attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of each day our senses, our senses are receiving so much more data than probably the brain can be <unk>
And as nothing matters to us more than survive, the first stop of all of those data is an ancient clip of the temporal lobe, called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector.
<unk> and records all the information for something in the environment that could make us damage.
So this is why a <unk> story -- look at the negative.
That old adage from the <unk> "If there are blood, <unk> is very true.
And because all digital devices give us negative news, the seven days of the week, 24 hours a day, no wonder that we are <unk>
It's not surprising that people think the world is going wrong with worse.
But maybe it's not that way.
Maybe in change, what really happens is we get <unk>
Maybe enormous progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems, the climate change, the extinction of species, the water extinction.
As human beings are very good at <unk> the problems and, in the long time, we ended up with them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
Over the last hundred years, the average of life has been more than <unk> average income per capita is actually <unk> it's <unk> all over the world.
Child mortality has shrunk 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food, of transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful time of human history.
And Charles <unk> that global literacy went from 25 to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people do it.
And we continue to make it more and higher expectations at all.
In fact, let's get the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, much of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water, toilets, <unk> television, mobile television, air conditioning and cars.
<unk> <unk> of the last century, the <unk> on the planet, would never have dreamed of such <unk>
And so much of this is the technology and, lately, it's exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that you could see in information technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law and double the performance of the price at about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile reason that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer from the 1970s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to see two things on this curve.
First of all, the soft thing that is -- in good and bad time, in the war and peace, in recession, and <unk>
It's the end of fast computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop before any of the big challenges.
And even though it's <unk> on a law on the left, the curve is curve up.
The growth rate of technology is more and faster.
And on this curve, to Moore's Law Law is a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we tell today.
So the cloud in the cloud, that my friends in <unk> call infinite computing, sensors and networks, and their ability to democratize and distribute personalized production -- all the planet, the synthetic biology, the fuels and the food, the <unk> the digital medicine, the <unk> and the <unk>
I mean, how many of you saw the victory at "Jeopardy" of Watson, from <unk>
It was <unk>
I came up with the newspapers the best headline they <unk>
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
He plays the <unk> of the human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence on the cloud, available for all in the mobile phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new college called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can you be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or a service that can affect human people's lives in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact a billion people.
30 years ago, I would have <unk> absurd.
Today, we can point out a <unk> of companies that have done it.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean creating life <unk> for every single <unk> is about creating a life of the possible.
It's about taking that to be scarce and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk> <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
We took dinner the king of <unk>
<unk> troops with <unk> and the same <unk> with covered with gold.
But King of <unk> ate <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal in the planet, it was more than gold and <unk>
For that reason the tip of the state of Washington to Washington is <unk>
You see, although aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come as a <unk>
It's tied to oxygen and <unk>
But then the <unk> came up and made of aluminum something so cheap that we used it as if it were <unk>
It is an analogy for the future.
Let's think about energy supply.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a <unk> planet, for 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to the Earth 16 <unk> every 88 minutes.
It's not about <unk> but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy fell 50 percent last year.
Last month, the MIT published a study that shows that by the end of the decade, in the <unk> parts of the United States, electricity will cost six cents per hour compared to 15 cents in the national average.
And if we have abundance of energy, we also have abundance of water.
Let's talk about the wars for water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed to the Voyager spacecraft to the Earth, in 1990, after the country <unk>
It took a famous photo -- how do you <unk>
"A pale point.
Because we live on a water planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent.
Yes, the <unk> is saltwater, by saltwater, the two is ice, and we <unk> the water on the planet, but there is a hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes the nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I would like to share with you, gave me permission to <unk> your technology called <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> is the size of a small refrigerator body.
It is able to generate 1,000 liters of drinking water a day of any <unk> saltwater, water water, including <unk> for less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola just thought that will make an important test for hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have full confidence that this will be, Coca-Cola will implement it in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is a <unk> innovation.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to the 70 percent penetration of mobile phones in the world in the end of 2013.
<unk> that mighty warrior has better communications communications in the midst of Kenya that President Reagan did 25 years ago.
And to tell you with a smart mobile phone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have ever been happening.
Now better than that, the things that you and I have paid dozens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video -- video -- video books, and computer books and music, technology -- diagnostic technology now <unk> and lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best coming up when it comes to the health change.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation, which is called the X Prize <unk> <unk> 10 million dollars.
We are challenging the world's teams to make these technologies on a mobile device that they talk about, and because they have <unk> you can extract blood from your finger.
To win has to make better diagnostics that a <unk>
Imagine this device in the middle of the world in which there are no doctors, where the payload is <unk> is 25 percent and there are <unk> of health workers.
When this <unk> device -- a <unk> of RNA or DNA that won't be able to call the <unk> and first of all, avoiding the pandemic.
But this is the greatest force to produce a world of abundance.
I call it the billion increasing.
The white lines here are the population.
So we've just passed the brand seven billion of the <unk>
By the way, the best protection against population explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, we'll spend two billion to five billion Internet users.
Three billion minds never before <unk> that you add to the global conversation.
What would these people?
What do you say? What would you say?
And instead of an economic collapse we will have the greatest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And health care thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy of the Academy and because of the use of impressions of 3D and computing in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we give us 3,000 million more members of mankind, healthy polite and <unk>
How about some voices never before <unk>
What if we give them the oppressed, wherever they are, a voice to be heard and be able to act for the first time?
What did these three billion?
And if they are contributions we can't <unk>
One thing I learned with the X Prize, is that mobile equipment, guided by his passion with a goal of course, can do things that could only make the big corporations and governments.
I'm going to end up sharing a story that really excites me.
There's a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how to fold the protein.
The crease shape the structure and the functionality.
It's very important in medical research.
And so far, it was a <unk> problem.
They have played with these college professors, among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people came in, and they started <unk>
And it's been shown that today the machinery of human patterns is better by folding any of the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power to take the great challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the <unk>
We have the capital of <unk>
And we have three new minds that are going on to us to work on the solution of the big challenges and do what we should do.
We have a few extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
I <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I'll give you three examples to make time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, like you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that they were <unk> but it wasn't like that.
It actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was the <unk>
He got it a lot to the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red <unk>
But we've heard this story a lot of times, about Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special.
But the case is that we still come into the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The brochures still say they keep <unk>
So what about here?
The second story, also illustrates another concept.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a lagoon in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could tell you."
I burned a lot with the sun, and I was convinced that I wasn't there.
This is my first exhibition in the sun.
The lagoon was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, from some <unk>
There were <unk> from about 20 millimeters a black beard <unk>
And the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a very good time, so it became more than the average in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the amount of fish had dropped in half.
I went to the five centimeters.
It was a genetic pressure.
There were still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
So nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of <unk> <unk> in Southeast Asia.
In the 1950s, <unk> started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
The fishing development was meant to impose out to the countries that had 100,000 <unk> <unk> industrial fishing.
And this boat is pretty bad -- he called the <unk> 4.
I went out to fish in it, and we did studies in the south of the Eastern China, and, above all, in the <unk> Sea.
What we captured was a <unk> thing.
<unk> I mean, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we capture was <unk> other animals that are in the background.
And most fish are <unk> tiny spots about <unk> remains that are <unk>
In short, the bottom of the sea came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
Within a year, you do a study and then start the commercial fishery begins.
The bottom line is going to be a solid coral background in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a <unk>
Not <unk> The <unk> because they were dead.
We once captured a living one.
I wasn't <unk>
And so they wanted to go back, because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what the fishermen collect every time you go to an area where you have never fish.
But it's not <unk>
We don't remember.
It took the starting point to start at the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
And on the Y-axis, we have <unk> biodiversity, amount of <unk> the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation will use the <unk> images at the beginning of their conscious life as the normal thing and push it forward.
The difference is that they perceive loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the accumulation of changes.
And at the end of the end of the way, keeping a lot of <unk> remains.
And that, in a lot of extent, we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that they don't are, or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies, kill animals without knowing what they've done to about generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that is very plentiful, before <unk> is <unk>
You don't lose animals.
You lose animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a great loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in an equal sea of big fish.
They become rare because the <unk>
With time there are a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, scientists, which was very different.
And they'll do it because the evidence presented in a way earlier that they would expect that the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of them were, as a captain of the way that the captain is like a lot of fish in this area cannot be used or generally use the scientists in the fishery, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in <unk> societies, because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
And there the enormous role that can play a protected zone.
Because with marine protected areas, we really recreated the past.
<unk> the past that people can't conceive of, because the starting point is run and is extremely low.
That's for the people who can see a protected protected area and can benefit from vision that enables them to erase their point of <unk>
And what about the people who can't do it because they have no access, like people in the Middle West, for example?
I think that the arts and cinema may not fill the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of the <unk> Bay.
A long time ago, there were gray whales gray whales in <unk> <unk> 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that the <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were moved with the film, they would talk about the story of <unk> why <unk> with the <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one that giving, is to Cameron, to make <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> manager and I look at YouTube videos in a professional way.
It's true.
So today, we're going to see why the videos are made and what important it has to do.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed something very, very hard.
But today the web is making any of us, or of our actions, they come together in a part of our world culture.
Anybody can be done on the Internet in a <unk>
They go up over 48 hours of video to YouTube for a minute.
And of these, only one little percentage is <unk> gets lots of <unk> and a cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of trends, communities and <unk>
Okay, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh, my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video out of his house in the National Park.
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This graph shows the views of the popular rise of last summer.
<unk> was not intended to do a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow.
That's what you do if it's called Mountain Mountain <unk>
I had already published many videos of nature.
This video was published in January.
So what happened here?
He was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this tweet that I would put in the video to the popular.
<unk> of the trends like Jimmy <unk> is presented with new and interesting things to a larger audience.
Rebecca <unk>  It's Friday --   -- you all want to get the end of a week, the weekend.   And --  -- <unk> Friday. So a Friday.  KA: You will think that we could have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> from Rebecca <unk> is one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed like going out of nothing.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> it's also a Friday.
But what happened on this particular particular stage.
Well, it took <unk> and a lot of blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> <unk> Science Science was one of the first people to make a joke about video Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or a group of user creators embrace a point of view and share it with a larger audience, accelerating the process.
So this community of people who share this big internal joke then starts to talk about that and do things.
And now there are 10,000 miles of <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each of the other days.
Unlike the 20th century, unlike the 20th century, this community involvement community is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an automatic animation with an automatic music.
So that's it.
This year you saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know that there is a three hours of three hours that has seen four million times.
The cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats see the video.
But the important thing here is creativity that woke up between the Internet <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Somebody did a version of the ancient one.
And then it became international <unk>
All of a sudden, a whole community of <unk> that made this happen to be a dumb joke to something that we all can be part of.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or Rebecca Black or <unk> <unk>
What do you script could have written this situation?
In a world where you go up two days of video per minute, just the only one and unexpected can be <unk> so that these things have done it.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a guy who protest against the <unk> to <unk> in New York, I wish I wasn't too interested in it.
Casey <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> but often there are some obstacles that prevent you from the <unk>
KA: Thank you as a surprise effect and your humor, Casey <unk> made it that five million watched and understand your idea.
So this approach is worth everything new that we do in a creative way.
And all of this leads to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators of bias, creative communities, how unexpected, are characteristics of a new media -- of a new culture, which we all have access and is the audience that defines very popular.
As I said before, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
They didn't get permission to express their ideas.
Now we're all a little owners of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media -- it's just the current media, but <unk> the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a lifetime.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life whose entire life had been supported in the only one of the one and freedom of their country.
<unk> while the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
And the words for so much time friends, now I read it.
They were <unk>
He died in the story.
He's my grandfather.
I never met it.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My job was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to <unk> but I read it.
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at the dawn of <unk> <unk> into the ocean.
My mother, <unk> had only 18 years old when his father died, and a little bit of marriage and two girls and two girls.
For her, life had been destined for a <unk> task of his family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do it.
And after a <unk> 10 years that defies fiction, a boat was able to be able to be able to go down to the sea as they were dressed up into sea <unk>
All of the adults knew the risks.
The greatest fear was the deforestation, the rape and death.
As most adults, my mother was wearing a poison.
So if you were given to us first, we would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant pace of the motor, <unk> diving into every wave, and the vast and vacuum.
I don't remember hackers who came several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of men in our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to take for six hours.
But I remember the lights on the entire oil platform, in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, to finish the journey was too much for it, and the first apple I did, given for the men on the platform.
No apple had then the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations shaping a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a suburb of <unk> which is the population of <unk>
Unlike the middle class, unlike the middle class whose existence I read in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
<unk> that came from the shops were the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English is <unk> among the people who had one thing in common: were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then in a car assembly line -- working six days, <unk>
Yet, I found time to study English and get a title in IT IT from the <unk>
We were poor.
And all of the dollars were <unk> and they developed an extra mentoring in English and math that doesn't matter what it should be, which was generally <unk> it was always <unk>
Two tutoring pairs for school, one to hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there were rare and <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> <unk>
Back home, where?
One is <unk>
I was accumulating and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my mother and I was <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were given to us about our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother in the house.
My mother had <unk> all of the ship.
And my task was to be <unk> until your nightmares started to be able to be able to <unk>
She opened a computer store, and then I studied to be <unk> and it opened another business.
And the women would come with their stories about men who couldn't do the <unk> angry and <unk> and <unk> boys caught between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classic <unk> student with what I was talking about about myself.
On the other hand, I was <unk> in lives -- tragically <unk> by violence, drug abuse and insulation.
But many of them got help over the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of lawyers, I picked the young Australian Australian young year.
And I was <unk> from a piece of the puzzle to the other, but its edges of <unk>
As <unk> <unk> resident was now as <unk> refugee and social activist -- invited to speak in sites that I had never heard of, and in homes whose existence she would never have imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the <unk> and the comfort of life in a suburb <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters end up the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of each one and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age that she was when she went into the ship.
He didn't have been an option.
<unk> said to me, "and you're not <unk>
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> the marginalized and <unk>
And the more frankly I was talking about it was <unk> to talk.
I met people from all the paths of life, so many of them doing what they were living on the border of the possible.
And although I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't be in a <unk> career.
It had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized the same time that it's okay to be a stranger, a newly <unk> new one in the scene -- and not only is good, but it's something that is so being grateful, maybe a gift of the ship.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world is <unk> but not the way we fear it.
They didn't have been <unk> they were tremendously.
There was a power there, a <unk> optimism sort of humility and <unk>
So I kept my intuition.
It was going to be a little group of people who <unk> <unk> can't afford it was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, I would make a giant pot of soup.
It <unk> all the way at night.
Most of our ideas were mad, but some brilliant, and we open us up.
I took the decision to move to the U.S.
After one journey.
My <unk> again.
Three months later, I had <unk> and the adventure <unk>
Before I end up, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time when the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life had not changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up alone.
At 17 became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without support of his husband, he caused a <unk> to the <unk> and bringing the cause she itself, and much more <unk> caused when I won it.
The <unk> cannot be proved to be wrong.
He was in the shower in the room in Sydney. when she died, 1,000 miles in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and saw I saw it on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around her <unk>
We tell the stories and make sure we were still with it.
At night a monk came and told us that he had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to raise his hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you have taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"You don't have <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since the people who we were and how life built us, we can now see that the men who have come to our lives would have been <unk>
The defeat was very easily.
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the ship.
Who might wish that for you?
However, I fear the privilege of what's easy, of the right.
I can give you a <unk> in your lives, diving brave in every wave, the <unk> pace of the motor, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give it and see them safe I would do.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of so much today, in the fourth or a fifth row.
My story starts in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed since the age of ancient <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when Indians wanted to travel to a car and <unk> the sky.
We now do it with airplanes.
At that time, when we <unk> the great Indian prince of the big prince -- he was <unk> he pulled out a bow and a <unk> on the floor, he got water.
We now do the same thing with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we took was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that struck me a lot.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I would give myself this idea of losing the ability to enjoy the ability to enjoy a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't get my friends.
It seemed like the technology had to allow the magic to allow the magic to allow the <unk>
As a child, my grandfather gave me his <unk> <unk>
And this sort of technological piece was to my most magic thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of <unk> and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that mobile phones, the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent them.
We had our inspiration.
And so I <unk> I came up to this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, instead of <unk>
It was books from the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad I saw a storytelling device able to connect the readers of the entire world.
You can know how we take the book.
Where we are, where we are.
You put the text with the image, animation, the sound and touch.
<unk> becomes increasingly <unk>
But what does that look like?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive app for the iPad.
It says, <unk> your fingers on every light."
And so --  he says, "This box belongs to <unk> I write my name.
And so I come back a character from the book.
In many moments you get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live in the ground because of GPS -- that comes led to me.
My inner child is excited about all these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean magicians and dragons, but to that <unk> magic -- those ideas that we <unk> of children.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar always turned out to me.
So over here, we need to shift the iPad to release the fireflies.
And I really light your way in what your life in the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated with a little girl was that a whole <unk> galaxy in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world turns into a <unk> that I drag into this magic device inside the device.
And this opens a map.
In all of a fantasy book, there's always been maps but have been static maps.
This is a map that is growing, <unk> and guide you for the rest of the book.
In certain points, the book is also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another incredibly important aspect for me is to create Indian and contemporary content.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of the fairies and the <unk> but how many people outside India know their counterparts <unk> <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the chambers of Indra for millennia, in an old and <unk> book.
That's why we are bringing them back into a <unk> children's story.
In a story that deals with current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that kids have been <unk> attached to their <unk> not have left the world.
But now with mobile technology, we can take our children into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions in the book is this adventure that you need to go out on the outside, take the camera or iPad, and we collect images from different natural objects.
As a child, I had a lot of <unk> <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason kids don't do it.
So to reclaim this childhood ritual -- you have to go out and, in a chapter you have a picture of a flower and then <unk>
On another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then you get <unk>
So this way is created a digital collection of photos that you can put on the Web.
A child in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A kid in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photos that have been taking.
Within the variations of the connection between magic, the Earth and technology is many possibilities.
And in the next book we have an interaction where you get out with the iPad and the video on the video on and actually through <unk> you see a bunch of cartoons that appear on the inside plant plants.
At a moment the screen is full of leaves with leaves at a moment.
And you have to make the sound of the wind and try to be able to read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world where the forces of nature is linked to technology and magic and technology come to each other.
It takes the power of the sun.
We are approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic, joy and love that we sat in a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why a lot of projects from <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things that we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> to a listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or you and asked patients, family and <unk> What <unk>
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think that this is one of the greatest problems that all of all, or maybe not all of us, but most of the projects of <unk> fail, we already stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale. It's very simple.
It has a facial <unk> and <unk>
Every morning I get stuck.
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I put the challenge to get to 95 percent.
But it's so simple, that every time I <unk> it sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight issue is not at the same time that I need to get care of it, or some urgency that style is that I would see it backwards.
But there's something else.
Like some of you know, I have more than 4,000 Twitter followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect my scale to my Wi-Fi scale and before you get up to my car, people start <unk> <unk> I think you need a light.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure pressure to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients quit smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people out of their chairs and together to develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From the next week it's available to be available.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And the people who are <unk> from their houses, to take their blood pressure, <unk> their doctor and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, return to reclaim the control and being captains of their own <unk> but it can also help us care health care because of the challenges that we face, like the firing of the costs of attention -- the demand and other issues.
We have techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like this, but also through <unk>
And one of the things we did I'd like to share with you with a video of video.
We all have checks in <unk>
Maybe even we have in our phones.
We know perfectly where the <unk> <unk>
So where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find strings of fast food.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked but nobody <unk>
No one knew where to get <unk> saves lives right now.
What we did was do <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public <unk> you see a <unk> please make sure where, and when it's open, because sometimes you open up in <unk> and others are closed.
And more than 10,000 people were introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the app for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and someone <unk> can use your iPhone, and the next weeks to use your cell phone to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I would like to introduce this one, not just as <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as a <unk>
And we want to take it to the world level.
We are <unk> all the colleagues in the world, at other universities, so that we will help us find work and act like a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and somebody <unk> it can be a relative or somebody in front of you, you can find it.
I also wanted to invite companies around the world that could help us <unk> these <unk>
You could be <unk> or <unk> people, for example, to see if the <unk> which is still shown in place.
Please focus on this and not only improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here for sharing <unk> photography.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, they're photographs that they can't take with their cameras.
My interest in the photograph was woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
I mixed with my earlier passion for the drawing but it was a little bit different because when I used the camera the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends up when the <unk>
To me photography had more to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that starts to press the <unk>
So let's make it like this: a construction on a very small road.
But it has a <unk>
And yet, it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful at the common goal of keeping the reality level of <unk>
And when I say realism I say <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something that I can do, but I always want it to seem to be captured in some way like photography.
<unk> where you have to think a moment to discover the <unk>
It has more to do with capture an idea that in catching a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it seem true.
They're the details or the <unk>
Did you get light?
What does the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But at the end it is about how we interpret the world and how you can perceive it on a <unk> surface.
It's not really about whether it's realistic but what we think is <unk>
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects, something that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But it combined in a certain way can create something that still seems like <unk> as if they were there.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So let's turn into the brain because the brain doesn't accept the fact that it doesn't really make any sense.
And I see the same process of combining the pictures.
It's really about combining different realities.
And the things that make a picture look like realistic I think they're those in the ones that don't even understand the things that surround us in our everyday lives.
But when we combine photographs, it's very important to <unk> because otherwise something is going to be wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to achieve realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Second, the pictures -- you have to have the same kind of light.
And these two images meet these <unk> they were taken at the same height and the same kind of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the principle and the end of different images with a perfect <unk>
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
Here's another example.
You might think that this is an image of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this picture is completely composed of photographs of different places.
And I think it's easier to think that it's easier to create a place that you find out because you don't need to put the ideas that has on your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in the winter I knew I had several months to try to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing ride.
The shores are a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a thick rock.
And yes, I even did a red house at the top of the island of the island that it looks more like <unk>
So to make a realistic outcome that I think it takes planning.
You start with a <unk> an idea.
Then you have to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures the result can be very beautiful and rather <unk>
All the tools are there and the only edge is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'll start showing you a slide of technology, very boring.
If you can <unk>
It's a diagram that I took from a portfolio of mine.
I'm not interested in showing you the details but the general thing.
This is an analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area networks.
The interesting thing about this is that this one, as a lot of other things we usually see is a straight kind of line on scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves is something new.
Here's something strange here.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please turn on the lights.
You get more intensity because writing on paper.
Why do we <unk> <unk> curves at <unk>
The answer is that if you draw the answer to a normal curve that say, these are the years, or some unit of time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to give you the diagram would see something ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say too much.
But if you ask for example, some other technology, like transportation, it would be very silly, we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives you a <unk> change.
If the technology of transportation will quickly be as fast as <unk> past tomorrow we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go down to that rhythm.
There is no <unk> in history of technological development that every few years will advance orders of magnitude.
The question that I want to make is -- is to look at these <unk> curves we see that they don't keep forever.
It's not possible to support this change as fast as it goes.
It was one of two things.
Or it's okay to turn into a typical curve, I know like this to come up something completely different, or maybe I'll do something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe happen something like this.
So now we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what used to be the world, a new way.
So what I try to ask, and ask myself, "What is that new way that we have the world?
So why is the new state going to the world?
The transition seems very, very confusing if we are engaged in it.
I remember that the future was happening in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future remains 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been spent year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel that something is going on.
And we can feel a transformation. We can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different that extrapolate that we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how that might be, how could that transition that we <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have much to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and looking at long-term things.
The scale of time I would like to do that is the time of life on Earth.
I think this picture makes sense if we look at every billion years.
So we go back about a half thousand million years ago when the Earth was a big sterile rock with a lot of chemicals that are going on around it.
If we see the way those chemists were organized together, we give us an idea of how things happened.
And I think that there are theories to start to understand the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that is that, at that time, there was a few <unk> oil with all kinds of chemical recipes inside.
Some of those oil droplet had a particular combination of chemicals that made them into the outside of the outside and the drops grew up on the <unk>
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the most invasive cell forms, those <unk> of oil.
But those drops weren't alive in the current sense, because each one of them contained a random prescription of chemicals.
And every time you get <unk> you get a distribution of the chemical <unk>
So every single <unk> was a little different.
In fact, the drops that somehow they would be able to be able to be better at the time of adding the chemical <unk> which is more chemical -- more chemical and <unk> more.
Most of them live longer, they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, a very simple chemistry, but the things are getting interesting when these drops learned the trick of abstraction.
So somehow we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to keep information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this <unk> evolution, a force of writing that allowed them to record what they were for <unk>
The incredible thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved a half billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, they have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living being that is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things that I did for <unk> now we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of white dust that I try to hide from the airport security.
But <unk> I took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use on this -- and I wrote my personal data in this piece of DNA and put it 10 to the 22 times.
So if someone wants 100 million copies of my personal card -- I have a lot of all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If I was a <unk> I would have put it in a virus and would have spread it in the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells be happy another billion years.
But then another great step of interesting step in which things are very different, which is that these cells started to exchange and communicate information forming that cell communities.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can trade DNA.
So for example, for example, evolved resistance to antibiotics.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin and <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there's a lot of resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave rise to communities which, in a way, were together, and established a <unk>
From that way, or <unk> together, whatever if a community was very successful it was very successful all the individuals in that community get more and <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point occurred when these communities came very close to that, in fact, they came together, and they decided to write the entire recipe for the board in a DNA chain.
The next stage interesting for life took another billion years.
And at that stage we have communities with communities of many different kinds of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't serve without the heart of the heart, or the brain of the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and became more interesting levels than cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that they didn't do more than process information in community.
They're <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that these cell communities built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being responsible for <unk> to understand and transmit information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the length of an organism, and not to the period of evolutionary time.
So an organism could, for example, learn to not eat some fruit because he knew bad and sick the last time they ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism because before they had built these information processing structures that they would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals that ate that fruit does.
So the fact that the nervous system actually built those information structures actually accelerated the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen to an individual.
It could happen in time we need to learn.
But then, of course, the individuals found the trick of communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea in the head.
I'm here sitting here looking at a <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, vague and <unk> in your heads that keeps some analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated that we turned it into sound, in sound, and we make something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started making <unk>
We now go through similar periods of the similar <unk> organisms -- our <unk> methods -- presentation and processing information.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
<unk> computer <unk> <unk> <unk> and so forth, are the specialized mechanisms that we now built to handle that information.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and capable of evolving more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen at once.
You already saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where it produced a certain evolution with the <unk> program before our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the time scales again.
The first stages of the history I told you took a billion years each.
The next few stages, and the brain, it took a few hundred million years old.
And then the beyond, and so on, they took less than a million years.
And beyond, like electronics, it seems to take a few decades.
The process is <unk> I assume that <unk> is the right word to name something that accelerates its own pace of change.
The more changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I get my life designing computers, and I know that the mechanisms that work for <unk> would not be possible without the recent technologies.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to express ourselves.
I don't know that every transistor in that connections.
There are thousands of millions.
Instead of <unk> designers -- we think about a level of abstraction, we put it into the machine and the machine with that something that we didn't get in, it gets much further away and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes it uses methods that don't even understand good.
A particularly interesting method, I've been using <unk> is evolution itself.
So we put into the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of time.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million instructions to chance?
You could run these instructions from instructions at random, run all of those programs, and take those that more <unk> what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to see numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are closer to data.
Of course, it's unlikely to be a few random sequences.
But one luckily, he could find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those random sequences that <unk>
They took those and <unk> the rest.
And now they get the best people to take the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of analog to <unk>
So let's take two programs, which is <unk> <unk> who <unk> <unk> and that children will have the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of programs from the combinations of programs that had a little more successful.
And we say, "Please repeat <unk>
Let's go back again.
So we had some mutations in it.
And it tries to try and carry another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can make the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in a little bit of complicated, in a few hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that are reading numbers in a perfect way.
In fact, they're a lot more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs, I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to run this to see how they work.
These are strange programs, strangers.
But they get the <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the security of the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that they did.
In fact, their lives depend on doing it.
One time I was going on a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he takes a card and says, "Look at this.
He says, <unk> airplane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> that work together to offer a <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they get complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering.
However, we don't understand all the choices that there is.
It is in front of us.
We now use those programs to make computers much faster and so can be able to run these programs much faster.
I mean, <unk>
The thing is getting faster and faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all of these technologies get stuck.
We're <unk>
And we are at an analog moment to the <unk> organisms when they got <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant to think that we are the ultimate product of evolution.
And I think we all are part of the creation of what it is to come.
But now it comes lunch and I think I'm going to stop here before I get stuck.
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that needs to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've <unk> enough time to let me give me a part of my fake <unk>
Before I get the issue of my talk, let's talk a little baseball.
Why not?
We are close to the end, the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
The baseball is filled with amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because of <unk> <unk> talking about the statistics and we used to make a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope many of you know.
It's called the average of <unk>
And we're talking about 300 percent of a <unk> that I would have to hear 300.
That means the bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball into the field of play without being <unk> and that anybody who tries to reach out to the first base of it, don't get to time, and the second base will be <unk>
three <unk>
You know how you call a 300 percent <unk>
Well, really good, maybe the team of stars.
You know what they call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that is somebody who was 10 strokes, hit four.
<unk> like Abraham Williams, the last player in the League of League <unk> -- in run more 400 hits in a regular season.
Now let's get this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable, or maybe less awkward, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and you have a surgeon who has a record of 400 in <unk>
So it doesn't work, right?
Now suppose they live in a remote place and a dear being has two clogged arteries and <unk> and their family doctor gets to an cardiologist whose record in <unk> is 200 percent.
But, you know what?
She's going to be getting better as this year.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I will ask:
What do you think it must be the average of hits a heart surgeon or a nurse or a nurse <unk>
1,000, very good.
And the truth of the matter is that no one in the whole medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, of a doctor or <unk>
What we do, though, is they send me to the world, and I included on being perfect.
We never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it right.
That was the message that I was going on when I was in medical school.
I was a <unk> student <unk>
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman amounts to a blood test.
Such a which.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the home of the hospital at General <unk> not far from here.
And I learned all of memory.
From my kind of anatomy, <unk> the origin and <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the diagnostic diagnosis and <unk>
And I even knew the differential diagnosis about how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge.
And I was very good, I graduated with <unk>
And I read from the medicine school with the impression that if you were to get it, then you would know everything, then you would know everything, and the nearest thing to do everything, because I would stop the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met the lady <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto when they brought the lady <unk> to the emergency room where I worked.
At the time I was assigned to the <unk> service.
And when the emergency room requested to a cardiologist was going to go to that patient.
It was reporting on the chief of their residents.
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound in both sides, which <unk> heart failure.
In these conditions, heart stops and instead of pump the blood forward, the blood goes to your lungs, these are filled with blood, and that's why there's difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I got to work on the treatment that I read it.
I gave him <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure on his heart.
I gave him <unk> of water, so it could eliminate liquid.
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt very good.
And it was when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I actually made two more mistakes.
He sent her home without talking to the chief chief of starvation
I didn't get up the phone and I didn't do what I should have done, which was to call my boss, and I would take him with it for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen it, it would have been able to deliver <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
I may not want to be a resident to pay constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to assume that I could take care of my patients without even touching my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When they send it to his house, I didn't take attention to a voice on my inner voice that would say, <unk> it's not a good idea. I didn't get it.
In fact, I was so unsure that until I asked the nurse that he would take on the lady <unk> "Do you believe that it's okay if you go to her <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said with total <unk> "Yes, I think I'm okay."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he was hiding the high and the ambulance with the <unk> they took her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach.
But I went on with my work.
At the end of the day, I would take it to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot where my car was to go home. At that moment I did something I don't do normally, I do something I do not normally do it.
It went into the emergency room service service at home.
And there was another nurse, not the <unk> of the lady <unk> before, but another one. He told me three words, those three words that most of the emergency doctors were <unk>
Other specialists fear them too, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and we see the patients <unk>
The three words are, you remember you?
He remembers the patient who sent her <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And they said, "Well, she would take the same tone of voice.
She was okay.
But I went back and on the edge of death.
In an hour of an hour that I would have come to his house, after I was able to give her the tall, he suffered a collapse and his family called the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> with a blood pressure pressure by <unk> which means a shock <unk>
I barely breathe and it was blue.
<unk> personnel -- all their resources.
They gave him medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put an <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mix of feelings because then the <unk> was in intensive therapy, and waiting against every hope that they would meet.
And in the two or three days it was apparent that never <unk>
He had a permanent <unk>
The family came together.
And in eight or nine days, they were <unk> what was going on.
And in the ninth day, he left the lady <unk> wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names of those who die.
That was my first experience.
The next few weeks ago, I was excited about it and experienced the <unk> shame that there is in our medical culture, and I felt lonely, <unk> without feeling healthy shame because you can't afford your colleagues.
You make peace and never more make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> shame I'm talking about is the one that makes us feel very bad about it.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad.
And that felt felt.
And it wasn't by my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family, and I'm sure I would take the stuff and made sure that I didn't care about it.
And I kept getting those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why was he sent to his home?
And in my worst <unk> why I made a mistake that <unk>
Why did I choose medicine?
Just that feeling was <unk>
And I started feeling better.
And on a <unk> day, it was opened up the sky and asked me if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with me that if you were to <unk> the efforts to be perfect for not making more mistakes, I would give those voices to do.
And it did.
I came back to work again.
It went back to happen.
Two years later, I was an assistant in the emergency department in a community hospital, in Northern Toronto, and I got a <unk> man with a pain in the <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I watched her throat, I was a little <unk>
He would give him penicillin and sent him home.
But as he ran to the door, he was following his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to do my primary change, my boss asked to talk to me <unk> in his office.
And he gave three words: You remember you?
Remember the patient who saw a pain in <unk>
Well, he came back and he had no <unk>
He had an potentially fatal condition. called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not the throat, but it can cause the closing of those tracks.
He wasn't gone.
You would give antibiotics for <unk> and recovered in the few days.
And he went through the same period of shame and <unk> and then I went back to work, and I went back and over and over and over again, and again.
Two times in the same turn of the emergency turn, not <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because they were <unk> to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't have sent them home and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought he had a <unk> calculation of it.
It turns out an X-ray of kidneys but it turned out, a colleague who was checking the patient, some sensitivity in the lower right-hand corner, and he called the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I read it a liquid order for <unk> and I asked my colleague to <unk>
I checked it down and when you see some sensitivity in the bottom right-hand corner, he called the surgeon.
Both of them were operated and they recovered well.
But every single case, I get rid of me <unk>
But I would like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as a lot of colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful have been for the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and <unk>
And here's the problem: if I can't tell me and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I show them that they don't make the same <unk>
If I would go into a place like this, I wouldn't have any idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard somebody talking about failure, after failure, after embracing failure?
Of course, in a party, you will hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you won't hear someone talking about your own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, as a <unk> in my hospital, the wrong leg -- believe it would have a hard time to look at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system that there are two <unk> that you make mistakes and the <unk> that you can't sleep and the ones I know -- the results that have great outcomes and the ones that have great outcomes.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction as antibodies that start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if we get away from medicine to people who make mistakes, will be safe for us.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years, about <unk> and medical journalism, I've done a personal <unk> personal <unk> and errors to learn how possible, from the first article that I wrote for the "Star Toronto to my <unk> <unk> Black <unk> Black <unk> <unk> <unk>
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where mistakes happen every day, in which one of 10 drugs are going on in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not right, in a system where hospital-acquired infections are increasingly more, and more <unk> causing havoc and death.
In this country, 100,000 Canadian Canadian errors are <unk>
The U.S. Medical Institute established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so on.
A <unk> system where knowledge is added every two or three years, and we don't get stuck.
sleep deprivation.
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow to make a perfect patient for the pain of pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain in the chest, and it comes <unk> with <unk> eyes, and so with <unk> and all of a sudden, my story is <unk>
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things always the same way.
And my patients are not cars. They didn't get their symptoms always in the same way.
For all this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system like we get rid of us, and we eliminate all of the professional professionals -- well, I won't get no one.
And with respect to that people don't want to talk about their <unk> cases.
In my <unk> white <unk> it's a custom of saying, "This is my worst <unk> I would tell everybody, from the <unk> to the head of surgery -- "This is my worst <unk> blah, blah blah blah blah -- "What are your <unk> and <unk> the microphone into them.
And their students were <unk> to go down and go down the head and put it up, and just start telling their stories.
They want their stories, they want to share them.
You can say, "Look, you don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where we can do it.
They need a <unk> medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The <unk> physician is human, you know, they accept it, they accept it and not proud of their mistakes, but he tries to learn from what happened to teach others.
They took their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about your mistakes.
<unk> the mistakes of other people not <unk> but in a loving way, and support for all of us.
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make errors time in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I am human, we would be able to get mistakes in it.
And I feel so much about it, but I strive to learn something that can be transferred to others.
I don't know what about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words -- I remember that.
Do you know how many decisions we take is <unk>
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
I recently did a survey of more than 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that he says to pick up a half American American.
It doesn't do a long ago in a research on a week to a group of companies.
The researchers recorded the different tasks of these executives and the time that we need to make decisions related to those tasks.
They found that on average, <unk> <unk> jobs per week.
Now obviously, every work included a lot of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of the time.
Now think about your choices.
Do you know how many you belong to the <unk> category and how many of an hour?
How are the way that manages those decisions?
Today, I want to talk about one of the greatest problems of <unk> choosing to the overload of choices.
I want to talk about the problem and some potential solutions.
While I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know your answers.
When you ask a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand only if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive please give you a <unk>
And now my first question of the day, are ready to hear the problem of the <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
As a graduate student at Stanford University, I had a very, very sophisticated level at least at least in that time was very sophisticated.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to a park in <unk>
There was like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 <unk> water, and this was when we made water from the tap.
I loved going to that shop, but I once asked me, why do I never buy anything?
This is the <unk> oil shelf here.
They had more than 75 different classes, including the ones that were in box <unk> that came from <unk> trees.
I decided to go to the manager and I asked him, "Well, this strategy of offering all these <unk> strategy.
He pointed to me the buses full of tourists which came out every day, usually with their cameras.
So we decided to do a little experiment.

They had <unk> different classes.
I put a post in the store.
We put out there from six <unk> or 24 different flavors and look at two things: First, what case people were willing to stop to test the <unk>
More people stopped when there was a 1960s, which when there was only six, 40 percent.
We also look at what case were more likely to buy a cup of <unk>
Here we find the opposite effect.
What they stopped when there was only three percent of us ever got to buy <unk>
What stood up when he had six, we saw 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, the people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they found six.
Well, what do you want you to do -- you don't buy <unk> you probably have a lot less good to keep the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the choices of choices affects us in very good decisions.
We decided to not decide, even when we don't get stuck.
Now the issue of the day, the financial savings issue.
I'm going to describe you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we see decisions about savings for about a million Americans, from about 650 plans in this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of funds funds available for savings for retirement, for retirement, the <unk> program will save people to save their future.
And we found that there was a <unk>
We had <unk> plans to go from two, to 59 options.
And we found that the bigger the number of funds were <unk> there were fewer participation.
So if we look at the ends, we see that in the plans that offer two funds, the rate of involvement was 70 percent or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans that <unk> about 60 funds, the rate of participation.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there's more options, even in that case, there are negative consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, the bigger the number of choices, more people will be committed to avoid stocks or hedge funds.
As soon as they had more choices, they were more willing to invest in financial accounts.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we need to do: to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade, we've seen three negative unintended consequences to the more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that the decision is that <unk> even when this is against self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst <unk> in finance and health.
You're more likely to pick things less <unk> even though you see them better.
The main reason is that we were looking at that gigantic array of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for comparison, to contrast and choose that amazing <unk>
Today, I want to <unk> four simple techniques that we've talked about in one way or another, in different research, so that they can test them in their business.
The first is, <unk>
You've heard it before, but it's never been more true than today, which is less than more.
People always stand up when I say, <unk>
Do they care about losing space in <unk>
But actually what we're looking at every time is that if you decides to cut, you get rid of odd <unk> you will have an increase in sales, get the costs, there will be a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> at 15 percent increase in sales.
When the corporation Golden <unk> we eliminated the products for <unk> of cats that least <unk> increased <unk> in <unk> by two <unk> and lower costs.
You know that the supermarkets today is 45,000 products.
In a Walmart store you have about 100,000 products.
But the largest largest store in the world today is <unk> and it provides only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato tomato tomato sauce.
In the financial savings world, I think one of the best examples that have come out of how to manage the choices is David <unk> the <unk> program.
All of the Harvard employees are <unk> it was automatically <unk>
Those who want to choose, they give them 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You know that people are often saying, "I don't know how <unk>
They are all demanding choices.
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences that are between those options.
And if your employees can't afford them, they can't do their <unk>
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was chatting with <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer people in this audience a holiday on the most beautiful road road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give you a applause if you're ready to take the <unk>
<unk> Okay. Anybody who's ready to accept the deal.
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a <unk>
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I really got to hear more hands.
All right.
Actually, you had more information on the first trial, which in the second thing, but I can tell you that they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images were made to be more real.
This brings me to the second technique to manage the problem of the overload of the <unk> which is <unk>
For people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each option, and that the consequences must be feeling very easily <unk>
Why do people spend 15 percent more on average when it uses debit cards or credit that when they use <unk>
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out to make it more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get more <unk>
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were being thrown into a <unk> plan.
At that meeting, you know, <unk> exactly how it was -- we made a little <unk>
What we added was that we would have a staff who would think of the positive things that they would take on their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in 20 percent and an increase in the amount they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put on their <unk> account.
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study that we did in a table of magazines.
We saw that in supermarkets, <unk> throughout <unk> <unk> the magazine can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But, you know?
Because <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> to give you a <unk>
<unk> <unk> Well, there's a few of them.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> to give you a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> But you know anything?
This rating framework is completely useless.
The categories must tell you something to you who <unk> not the <unk>
You often see this problem with these huge fundraising.
I am supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than we think about if just <unk> a little bit.
We need to increase the incremental complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's see a very good decision, the purchase of a car.
This is a German German maker.
You have to take 60 decisions to build the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of options that offers each one.
<unk> outside of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> <unk> box <unk>
What I'm going to do is change the order in which the decisions.
So half the clients are going to go from many choices, 56 colors, a few examples, four boxes.
The other half of the clients are going to go from a few options, four <unk> at 56 colors, lots of options.
And what am I going to do?
What do you get in.
If you <unk> the default button in every decision, it indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that the ones that go from many choices to <unk> <unk> the default button over and over again, and another one.
The <unk>
If you go from a few choices to many, they continue there.
Same information, the same amount of options.
The only thing I did was disrupt the order of information as the information.
If we started how easy, you learn to <unk>
Even though we pick the box of changes not to say anything about the preferences of <unk> we are able to make us choose.
We are excited about a product that we're building that we now have more <unk> with the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the <unk> <unk> problem, to eliminate alternate alternatives to make it <unk> <unk> we can handle more categories at least <unk> <unk> complexity.
All of these techniques that I've presented them were designed to help manage the <unk> or better for you, to use them in their own business, or for people who work.
It's that I think the key to getting the best of a choice is to be careful the <unk>
And how much more careful the choices we can do is we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the late years in the East Germany, I would say, if you had a typewriter to write it had to be taken to the government.
I had to record a piece of text of example written with the machine.
And this is why the government could track the origin of the texts.
If they found a written on the wrong message, they could track the footprint down to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that someone could do this, how much it would make the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser laser printer from any big manufacturer and printing a page, that page will end up having some yellow little printed dots on every page that follows a pattern on one and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody looks very much like this.
This is an example of the ways our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems on the network.
If we see what happens in the online world, we can put together the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups there.
Are the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> in Ukraine.
The <unk> mobile phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use <unk> to make a lot of money, a huge amount of money.
There are actually a lot of <unk> there are <unk> that we would make money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, and so on, etc., etc.
These guys do their <unk> online -- but they do it by illegal media through the <unk> to steal money from our bills when we buy them in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy a computer <unk>
The secret secret of America, two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I say today is more likely that any of us is a victim of a <unk> that in a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is wrong with worse.
In the future, most crime crimes online.
The second group of <unk> in importance that we see today is not driven by the money.
There's another thing that moves, they motivate them the protests, to motivate them to make laughs laughter.
Groups like Anonymous have been <unk> over the last 12 months occupying a huge role in the online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> the criminals who do it for money, the <unk> like Anonymous who do it to protest and the last group is the national government that we <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of a government attack against its own citizens.
<unk> is an authority.
<unk> the last fall because of a <unk>
They took the safety of the site and make a <unk>
I was asked last week I asked, in a meeting with the Dutch government representatives I asked one of the leaders if they were <unk> <unk> death of people from the attack to <unk>
And the answer of it was yes.
So how do people die from a attack from these?
<unk> is an authority <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Why do we have <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services like <unk>
Except that <unk> a foreign <unk>
And they were <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the <unk> protesters the Egyptian secret police headquarters in April 2011, and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder, there were notes from a company based on Germany that had sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept the communications from the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool by 280 euros to the Afghan government.
The company headquarters is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide tools for the governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments also do this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by the German government officers to investigate their own citizens.
If you're suspicious in a criminal case, you know, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But it's more there.
You get the connection to the Internet.
<unk> even tools like the <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to the online discussions to get our data.
When we think about things like these things like these the obvious answer should be "Well, it looks a bad thing, but I really don't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why do we <unk>
I have nothing to do it.
And that argument doesn't make any sense.
It's actually <unk>
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a matter of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could trust our governments today in 2011, any right that we spend today, it will be forever.
<unk> <unk> in any future government that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that must be worried about the next 50 years.
This is where I live, I live in Kenya, in the south of National Park.
These are the cows of my dad, the back and behind the cows, the National Park.
The National Park, it has no fences in the top of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate freely outside the park.
And predators, like the lions, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the ones that killed at night, and so soon we wake up in the morning, and we found it dead -- I was very bad because it was the only <unk> we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and the entire land for <unk> and so that we value it so much.
So I grew up <unk> a lot to the lions.
They were dying of their community and they protect our community and livestock and also be angry with the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of six lions that killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in the National Park in Nairobi.
A child in my community, at the age of six to nine years old, is responsible for the livestock of his father and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought that lions were afraid.
But I realized that I really didn't think about it, because even I helped the lions to see the pen away.
I didn't give me <unk>
One second idea was to use a <unk>
He was trying to trick lions so they believed that he was near the <unk>
But lions.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day lions didn't go.
I found that lions are afraid of the light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch on that turning out and turning the lights out.
And this is a little lamp.
It was all about everything.
As you can see, the solar cell load the battery and the battery -- electricity on the small box <unk> I call it a transformational.
And the <unk> box makes the lights up.
As you can see, the <unk> get outside, because that's where the lions.
And this is what lions can do when they come from night.
<unk> lights and <unk> the lions so you think that I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my home two years ago and since then, we never had a problem with lions.
And the neighborhood in the neighborhood heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals with male lions and asked me if he could put the lights up.
I said yes.
The <unk> You can see the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed it in seven houses in my community and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used by all Kenya, to freak out other predators like Mama <unk> and also being used for rid of their farms.
Thank this invention, I was fortunate enough to get a grant in one of the best schools in Kenya, International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is helping to raise funds and <unk>
I even took my friends to my community and we set up lights in the houses that don't have them, and teach them how to fix it.
So a year ago, it was just a kid in the meadows of the savanna <unk> the cows of my father, and used to see flying airplanes, and he said that someday would be inside one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in plane for the first time at TED.
My great dream is to be a <unk> of aviation and pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and the lions, can we be with lions without a conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture what exciting is to hear a story like yours.
So you got a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electrical inventions.
What's the next one in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do a fence to CA: CA: One near <unk>
<unk> I know you already invented electrical fences but I want to make mine.
CA: So I did that, once, right, and <unk> <unk> I've tried it before, but I stood up because I got a <unk>  CA: On the foot, Richard <unk> is a big thing.
We're going to get it on every single step that I <unk> my friend.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little girl, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "Not <unk> nothing."
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would come all the time by studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot of the rest of the world, except that Americas, South Korea, Japan is enemies.
Although sometimes I wondered about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea, until everything changed a sudden changed.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public run.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor and I was never starving.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister
And he said, "When we did this, the five family members will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two previous weeks.
We are <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak that we're ready to die."
It was very altered.
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
At a little time, when I was walking in front of the train, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
One <unk> woman was dead on the streets, holding a child <unk> in his arms looking at his arms face without being able to do anything.
No one <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
An enormous famine has been <unk> to North Korea to the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and only few people survived eating grass, insects and tree cortex.
They also became more and more common energy energy, all of me was completely dark at night except for the lights in China, just crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea at night compared to the countries today.
This is the <unk> River, which is central to North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to cross <unk>
But many die.
Sometimes, they saw bodies floating on the river.
I can't reveal the details of how I got out of North Korea, but I can only say that for the years of starvation I was sent to China to live with relatives <unk>
But I just thought I would be separated from my family for the short time.
I could never have imagined that it would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be like as refugee refugees.
But I suddenly learned that it's not just extremely hard, but dangerous, because the North Koreans in China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible destiny in North Korea.
A day, my worst nightmare became really done when I was arrested by the Chinese police and he was encouraged by the police.
And anybody had accused me for being <unk> then I <unk> my skills in the Chinese language, and they asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to explode.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end up.
But I managed to control my emotions and press the questions.
At the end of the <unk> an officer told another, "This was a false report. She's not <unk>
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans are looking for asylum <unk>
But many of them can be arrested by Chinese police and <unk>
These women had a lot of luck.
Although they had <unk> they were eventually released after an international pressure.
These North Koreans didn't have so much.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China, and <unk> North Korea, where they're <unk> imprisoned or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to escape many other North Koreans have not been so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight that hard to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, all their world can be made in a second.
That's why after 10 years to hide my identity, I've decided to make it back to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much larger challenge than I had expected.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a huge gap between North and South Africa.
We are all <unk> but inside, we've come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
Even he went through an identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no country I could call my pride with me.
Even though I went to the life in South Korea wasn't easy, and I did a plan. I started to study for the exam exam to college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities had some money that sent my family, and, as <unk> my family was going to be shifted to the force to a location in the <unk>
They had to run away immediately.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border of North Korea.
Since my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to make it somehow, for more than three miles across China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we were almost caught several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and tackled by a Chinese police officer.
He asked the <unk> and he started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, <unk> I stood up and I told him that they were <unk> who was <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but I looked at me.
We did all the way to the border border.
But I had to spend almost all of my money to bribe the border guards, in <unk>
But even after switching the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated across the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was released in a month.
But at the time, my family was arrested and imprisoned again at the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest ones in my life.
I did everything for free my family, and we were so close to it, but my family was <unk> in prison to the short distance of the North Korean <unk>
I was going and came between the immigration office and the police, desperately trying to release my family.
It didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man, "What is the problem?"
I was so amazed that a stranger would mind to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I was telling him the situation, and without <unk> the man was the <unk> <unk> and he gave me the rest of the money for my family and for another two North Koreans and <unk>
I read it with all my heart, and I said, "Why do I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> she told me.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind of unknown unknown to me and a new hope for me and the <unk> people when they <unk>
And he showed me that the kindness of strangers and the international community is really the rays of hope that the <unk> people need it.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea.
But the freedom is only half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with little or none of money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practice in the English language, business practices for work, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us are still in contact with family members, and we sent information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've got a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help giving North Koreans an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans <unk> all over the world, including at TED.
Thank you.
I live in South Center.
This is Center for <unk> shops and fast food stores -- cold terrain.
And so the planners of the city came together, and they thought, let's change the South Center for me to represent something else, so they changed the South Angeles to South Angeles as if it <unk> what's actually wrong in the city.
This is Los Angeles south --  -- <unk> <unk> faster, terrain.
Just like <unk> millions of other Americans, living in a food desert -- Los Angeles Center to the <unk> of food places to take and eat in the car.
The funny thing is that the places of food to carry more people than food in the car.
People are dying of <unk> diseases in Los Angeles Center at Los Angeles Center.
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times higher than say, Beverly <unk> which is like 15 miles away.
I would stop me to see this happen.
And I ask myself, how do you feel if you don't have access to healthy food, and if every time you go out of your house, you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in its <unk>
I look at wheels on wheels and sold as a self-driving cars.
I see <unk> centers, like <unk>
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
The food is the problem and it's the solution.
I also got tired of running 45 minutes to go back and buy an apple that doesn't have pesticides.
What I did, was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a strip of land we call a <unk>
It's about 45 me x three me.
The point is, that belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it.
I said, "Well, I can do what it comes to me in <unk> because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
So this is how I decided it worked.
So my group and I, L.A. Green <unk> we put together and we started planting our food forest forest trees -- you know, nine <unk>
So what we do -- we are a kind of paid group of <unk> made by gardeners of all the entire city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
And then someone gets <unk>
The city went on me on top of it, and at <unk> they gave me a <unk> saying that he had to remove my garden, the <unk> became order to go.
And I said, "Come on, right?
A court ordered by planting food in a piece of land that nobody <unk>  And so I was like, "Well, let's look at it.
Because this time wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had the written story by Steve <unk> and talked to the <unk> and one of the members of Green <unk> who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we went a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of the United States with more <unk>
It has 68 miles of land.
That's about 20 Central <unk>
That's enough space to plant millions of tomato plants.
Why on Earth do not look like this?
They took a plant to give a thousand thousand seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> I'll give you 75 dollars of a result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, <unk> your own food.
<unk> your own food is like to print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for Southern Center.
I grew up there. I grew up with my kids there.
I was struck by being part of this <unk> reality, which was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I grow my art.
Such a <unk> artist who <unk> walls, and I <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You get rid of what the land can be done, if you let your canvas.
You just can't imagine how amazing it is a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I'm witness to how my garden became an educational tool tool of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of land.
We are the land.
You can see how it affects the kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> act that they can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, they get <unk>
I remember one day that came a mother and her daughter, they were like the <unk> on the night and were in my garden, and they were very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame by looking at people who was so close to me with hungry, and this is just <unk> why I do this, people ask me, "We don't temes people going to steal your <unk>
What I say, "For God no, I'm not afraid that you go to <unk>
That's the street.
That's what it's about.
I want the <unk> but at the time, I want you to raise your <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a homeless shelter at the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, I was given his stories about how this had affected and how it used to plant with her mom and her grandmother, and it was great to see how it changed, so it was just for a moment.
So <unk> <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had about 50 people who come, work and <unk> all of them in the plan.
If kids grow up, the boys will eat <unk>
If you grow tomatoes, they'll eat <unk>  But if none of this is <unk> if you don't teach them how the food affects the mind and the body, they eat blind what they put in front of them.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing that are wounded.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these kids that were <unk> in their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
You may be producing next George Washington D.C.
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take container and turn them into healthy <unk>
I didn't believe me.
I'm not talking about free, because the free is not sustainable.
What's interesting about sustainability, is you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to put people out of the streets, to get the kids out of the streets, who know the joy, the pride and honor to grow their own food, by opening farmers.
What I want to do here, we need to make it sexy.
I want everyone to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We need to change the script of what a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
<unk> take their <unk> right?
That is their weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, they're not called if you want to sit on comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing a little bit of <unk> to talk about making some shit.
If you want to see me, you come to the garden with your <unk> so that we could plant something.
strong. Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me that this is a very good road.
It's made of <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days like today, where it rains a lot.
You can have a lot of water in the asphalt that we have <unk>
And especially if you go on on your bicycle and these cars go, that's not very nice.
Also, the asphalt may make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to cities, would you want a quiet road.
The solution for that is to make highways of asphalt <unk>
The asphalt <unk> a material that we use now in most roads in the Netherlands, has pores and water can go through it, so all the water rainwater flow into the sides and have a road that is easy to drive, and not <unk> the water never more.
Noise also disappeared in these <unk>
Because it's very open, all the noise disappear, so it's a very quiet road.
It also has <unk> of course, and the downside of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> Look at this road the stones on the surface of the surface of the surface.
First of a stone, then many more and more and more and more and more, and so on, and I'm not going to do that.  But you can harm your <unk> and you won't be happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create <unk> with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, can be turned into a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can really see how damage it comes up in this material.
It's an asphalt asphalt as I said, so only it has a little bit of <unk> between the stones.
Because of the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> they <unk> and if they <unk> they will be <unk> and they were separating from the <unk>
So if you drive around the road, you get the <unk> like we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think about material materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use <unk> of steel from that to clean up <unk> and we can cut the steel <unk> into very small pieces, and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little bits of <unk> of steel in it.
Then you need a machine, like the one that you see here, that you use it for <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially steel -- it's very good at that.
So what you need to do is to heat the steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow by these <unk> and the rocks are going back back to the surface.
I was using an oven oven, because I can't bring the great <unk> machine here onstage.
The microwave oven, is a similar system.
I put the sample, I'm going to take it to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this industrial machine in the lab to heat the shows.
So we tried a lot of samples there and then the government, you actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We need to be <unk>
So we donated a piece of road, 400 meters of the <unk> <unk> where we had to make a test <unk> to test this material.
So that's what we did there, you see where we were doing the test of the road, and then, of course, this road to last several years without any damage. That's what we know about practice.
We took a lot of samples from this road and we tested them in the lab.
We did a lot of the samples, we put a lot of payload into them, and we put a lot of payload on them, and then we have our <unk> machine, and we went back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can tell you that we've made a material using fibers of steel, bringing these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the lives of the surface of the road, even they can double the life of the surface, and they actually save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they're curious about whether this worked.
We still have the show here. It's pretty hot.
And it actually has to cool first before I can show you how I can play it.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having woken up a morning with the sound of the <unk> in my home.
My father was listening to the BBC News in his little gray.
He had a great smile in his face that was unusual at the time, because the news typically <unk>
"The Taliban <unk> she screamed at my father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> school told me.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban were <unk> in Afghanistan and made the girls were going to school.
For the next five years, I was given to me as a child to raise my older sister who couldn't be used outside, to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that the two we could <unk>
Every day, we would take a different route so that no one could be suspicious where it would be.
We had to hide the books out of the market to look like we were shopping.
School was in a house, more than 100 of us stuffed in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk>
We all knew that <unk> our lives, the students and our students and our parents.
In a while, the school suddenly <unk> for a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they did.
They were <unk>
Did you know where to come from?
We were <unk> but still the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters were <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for her time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan, <unk> in which his daughter, my mother was to the school, and so his father took it.
But my mother educated, became a teacher.
This is it.
It came back two years ago, just to turn our home home for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is, was the first of his family in getting education.
There was no doubt that their children had to get education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risk.
For him, there was a greater risk in not to educate his children.
Over the years of <unk> I remember there were moments that I was very frustrated with our life and was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money, you can let your house run for a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what is here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, to do it.
So you still want you not to <unk>
I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country which has been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women in my age have more than the high school, and if my family would have been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find this proud of college at <unk> College in <unk>
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, who was <unk> from his home for the courage to educate his daughters, was one of the first in <unk>
He didn't just get away from my college degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I am the first woman, I carry it driving across the streets in Kabul.
My family believe in me.
I dream in big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global commission of <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
It's because of what you're going to do, and you have the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is that I see the students in my school with the hard desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families who, like my mine, <unk> for them, despite the way and even in front of a <unk> opposition.
As <unk> it's not the real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month less than a month, and his daughter went on the way to his village, and they literally escaped to be killed by a bomb on the road, for minutes.
So when you get to your house, it's a voice <unk> that if I was still sending her child to school, it would come back to try.
<unk> already, if <unk> said, "but to harm the future of my daughter for her old and <unk> care.
What I've realized about Afghanistan, and it's something that is very often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of the people who <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of his daughter and he sees the success of her their own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been <unk>
In fact, they are the first compelling <unk> of the bright future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
With <unk> the girls who went to school, remember, remember, was illegal.
But today, more than three million girls are going to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan is so different from here in the U.S.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
It would argue that these changes didn't last a lot, after the retirement of the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school and his parents who were fighting for them, I see the future <unk> and a lasting lasting change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities -- and every day the little girls of <unk> I would tell me.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never have never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> <unk> against him.
But you never go back a revolutionary <unk>
It has been almost two years since the <unk> revolution was inspired by the <unk> of massive <unk> as long as <unk> revolution.
One forces with many other citizens <unk> inside and outside the country to call a day of anger, and start a revolution against the Tunisian regime of <unk>
And <unk> was a great revolution.
Women and young men who were <unk> were in the edge, <unk> the each of the regime, they were carrying billboards of freedom, dignity and social justice.
You have shown the <unk> the brutal dictatorship <unk>
You've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East, to the west, to the south.
Finally, after a six months of a six months of war in the brutal war and some loss of approximately 50 dead -- we managed to release our country and remove the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy load, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the Tunisian regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of society.
<unk> of the devastation and the challenges, I've loved with many other women, rebuild the civil society -- <unk> civil society and just to the democracy and national <unk>
There was about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> about 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a unique enthusiasm I started organizing workshops on the development of capabilities and skills of leadership.
With an incredible group of women we founded the <unk> of Women <unk> by the <unk> a movement of women, leaders, the <unk> orientation for the <unk> autonomy of the woman and by our right of the right of engaging with the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the period, an environment that was getting more and more <unk> than it was <unk> of selfish policies of domination and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was approved, our initiative was coming.
Women won a <unk> of the National Congress in the first elections in 52 years.
However, gradually the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, they were <unk> all the days of violence.
One day we woke up with the news of the <unk> of ancient mosques and <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news of the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder of the military officers of the army.
And every day, every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and their piles of human rights, the human rights of the prisoners and their lack of respect to the law.
Our society made up of a revolutionary mindset, <unk> more, and has gone away from the ideals of freedom, dignity, social justice, that we had at the beginning.
The <unk> and the revenge became the icons of the consequences of revolution.
I'm not here today for <unk> with our story of the success of the <unk> <unk> and the election.
Rather, I'm here today to confess that we, as a nation, chose bad, we take the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize good.
Because elections didn't brought peace to peace, stability and security to Libya.
The list of <unk> and the <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated with selfish policies of domination and <unk> for men as for women?
Perhaps what was missing was not only women, but the female values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and creation of consensus more than we needed the elections, which just <unk> polarization and <unk>
Our nation needs the universal representation of the most likely to need the representation of <unk> and quantitative of it.
We need to stop acting as agents of outrage and call some days of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We need to develop a female speech that not only <unk> but also put it in practice the mercy rather than <unk> our collaboration instead of competition, inclusion instead of <unk>
So these are the ideal that a Libya, <unk> for war, desperately needs to be able to reach peace to peace.
Because peace has a <unk> that tries to the <unk> and <unk> between women's perspectives and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to set out that in a existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the same time, the word <unk> which is known in all the <unk> traditions that the word <unk> <unk> feminine and <unk> that spans the humanity of men and women, that all tribes and all the peoples have <unk>
And like the uterus completely covers the <unk> that grows inside, the divine matrix, of compassion is that it brings all the existence.
This is what it tells us is "My <unk> <unk>
This is what he says, "My <unk> <unk> on my <unk>
That all of them are <unk> the <unk> of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a wonderful question that has a equally controversial question.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is the one that everyone makes a good thing. Why is it left?
Why was someone going to stay with a man who would love him.
I'm not a psychiatrist, or social worker, no expert on domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old, just at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York for my first job as a writer and editor in <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green <unk> American <unk> and he had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many, many times, the man, that I believed my alma mater, <unk> me on my head with a <unk> with a <unk> <unk>
The man who loved anyone who loved anyone in this world, put a gun on my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a collective <unk> <unk> <unk> where every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could even be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> in English at Harvard University, and I have an MBA in <unk> of Business Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies on the list of <unk> <unk> <unk> between them Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington D.C.
I have almost 20 years married with my second husband, and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and I drive a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all of the races, all the religions, all of the levels of income and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everyone thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and domestic abuse, only happens in <unk> and <unk> and long duration -- or, in the families, the last place where we want or we would expect to find <unk> which is why domestic abuse, is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that was going to be with a man who would stick with it, and I actually went a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States the women in between 16 and 24 years old, they have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and over 500 women and girls of that age are killed every year for partners, <unk> and husbands and <unk> in the United States.
I also was a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signals or patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold and November night of January.
I was sitting next to the subway in New York City, and he started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he was also just <unk> from a college <unk> <unk> and that worked on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what was most impressed me at that first meeting was ready and fun, and it seemed like a field.
He had some big <unk> like apples, and a <unk> hair, wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the most intelligent things that made me <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of a mate.
He did it on everything in the beginning of a <unk>
We started out and loved everything of me -- that I was so ready, that I had gone to Harvard, that I put passion to help teenage girls and my work.
I wanted to know everything about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and a woman, like nobody had ever done.
And it was why the <unk> of that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his future were so much important for him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I went out of New York and let my dreams, but I thought it had to do for your dreams for your partner, and so I went back, I left my job and <unk> and I went into Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling into a <unk> <unk> which was getting on head in a physical trap financial and psychological <unk>
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts it.
And this is where those <unk> come in.
As soon as we moved to New England you know, that site where it was supposed to be <unk> I had to feel so sure you bought three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another one he kept underneath the pillow in our bed, and the third always in his pocket.
And he said it needed those <unk> because of the trauma that lived from tiny.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those <unk> were actually a message for me and, although I had never lifted me my hand, my life was serious for danger, every minute of every day.
The first physical attack of <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
It was the seven of the morning, and I still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I put my <unk> my mother and married him.
Despite what had happened, I was sure that we were living happily in forever, because I loved him, and he also wanted me a lot.
And I was very, very <unk>
It was just very <unk> for the wedding and the fact that they form a family with me.
I had been an isolated accident, and I never would hurt me.
I spent two times more on our moon of honey.
And the first time I was driving toward a secret beach and <unk> and he gave me so strong in the head that I would have a lot of times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our moon of honey, he went through the traffic and threw a Big Mac on the face.
<unk> kept <unk> one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was embarrassed when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of three American women is a victim of domestic violence or <unk> at some point in their life, and the Centers for Disease Control that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So actually, I had very good company.
So back to my question: Why do I <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
On the contrary, I was a very strong woman in love with a profoundly <unk> man and it was the only person in the world who could help me <unk> to deal with their <unk>
The other question everyone else does is: Why don't you just get stuck.
Why didn't I <unk> I could have gone at any time.
So for me, this is the saddest and painful question that people do -- because we give us the victims, we know something that you normally have, is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of the killings in domestic violence occur after the victim has done to the relationship, after the <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include the permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has gone back to it -- even after the <unk> has gone back to the victim and the family court system for the victim and their kids, which are usually forced by judges to spend time not <unk> with the man who would raise their mother.
And so we still ask why they're just not going?
I was able to go, because of one last <unk> and beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved I would have killed me if he had allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told everybody the world: the police, to my neighbors, my friends and family, and I am here today because all of you would love me.
We have the trend to the victims of the <unk> <unk> women, <unk> goods.
The question, "Why do you <unk>
For some people to be a way to say <unk> is it by <unk> as if the victims <unk> intentionally <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also reported that they learned a remarkable lesson from what happened to them, and that they would save their lives joyful lives and happily like <unk> wives and mothers, lives completely free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I am a victim and a survivor, of very typical domestic violence.
I came back to marry a cute little guy and got these three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to go back to one is a <unk> clean gun pointing to my head in the hands of someone who says I want.
At this moment, as you're thinking, <unk> that's <unk> or <unk> what stupid <unk> but all this time I actually have been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, that they're being <unk> or they are <unk> they are <unk> themselves.
The <unk> could be affecting their daughter, his sister, his best friend right now.
I was able to put my crazy love crazy <unk> breaking the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request for you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
The abuse just thrive in silence.
They have the power to end domestic violence simply shedding light on it.
The victims we need to do all the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They took the abuse of that to light talking to their children, their friends, their friends and family.
Do you have a vision of the survivors as fantastic people and <unk> that have a future <unk>
<unk> the visual signs of violence to be able to do consciously, to stop their climb and show the victims a safe <unk>
And together we can turn our bed, our tables and our families in the <unk> secure and <unk> they should be.
Thank you.
Hi. I call myself Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be <unk> for 10 years ago.
And I feel that at this moment there is a uncomfortable tension in the room because I should not have just dressed up --  luckily, I've brought clothes to <unk>
This is the first set of clothes on a <unk> scenario so you have a lot of luck to <unk> I think.
If some of the women were <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to go back now, but they would find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These are very <unk> less <unk> I don't have to use.
The worst part is to go through this sweater by your head, because it's when you're going to make fun of me, so you don't do anything while I cover your mind.
All right.
Why did I do this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but it also <unk>
I've completely changed what you thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I'd never had a boyfriend, in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer told me that I would take my back and put the hair out of the kid.
Of course, except for surgery or an artificial <unk> that I did two days ago for the work, there is very little to be able to transform our looks, which, even though shallow and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, for me, being brave means to be honest.
I'm on this scenario because I'm a model.
Because I'm a nice woman and white woman, and in my labor sector, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people have always done, but they are <unk>
The first question is, how do you get a role model?
And I always say, a <unk> I was discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made myself a model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of an heritage, and maybe you're wondering what this heritage.
Well, in the last centuries we have not only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which we are biologically programmed to <unk> as well as a high and <unk> shape -- <unk> and a white skin.
And that's my <unk> heritage that I've known to leverage for making money.
And I know there are people in the audience who are now shown <unk> and maybe there are some <unk> from the fashion that <unk> <unk> There are <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk>
First of all, the <unk> to know both models. It's amazing.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York told all and every single model of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- <unk> <unk> -- I mean, less than four percent, not white people.
The next question that people are always making me is: Can it be a model when you grow up.
And my first answer is: I don't know that I don't take that.
But then, what I really would tell each of these girls is: Why? Can you be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or the <unk> <unk> ninja and poet, which would be awesome, because you are the first.
If after this spectacular list, it still <unk> no, no, I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of nothing, and you could be the <unk> <unk> <unk> magazine or the executive <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that you want to be a model that's like saying you want to win the lottery when you're older.
It's out of your control, it's shocking, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to show you everything that I learned in 10 years as model, because, unlike <unk> surgery, it can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you get down your studies, and you have a different jobs and some jobs on your back, no matter what you're going to say is to say, if you think you want to be president of the United States, but your partner would be Model underwear for 10 years, people would look weird.
The next question that people are always doing is whether all the pictures are <unk>
And yes, it's pretty much <unk> all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
And this was the first picture that I came in, and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my time.
I know that we are entering the ground, but it was a child.
It was looking at my grandmother a few months before.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party.
Here I am with my football team and in <unk>
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize I'm not me in those photos.
They are <unk> of a professional group, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is: <unk> things for free?
I have too many times of eight inches and never use, except the <unk> but the privilege I get is the ones I get in real life, and that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I went to a shop and I forgot to bring money, and they gave me the <unk>
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> stepped into a red light and, of course, <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent in order to continue <unk>
<unk> of these privileges because of my respect, not by what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their appearance without matter who they are.
I live in New York City, and last year of the <unk> teenagers who stood up and <unk> 86 percent were black and Latino animals, and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> black and Latino people in New York, for what for them, is not a matter of <unk>
But how many times are I going to happen to me, and I think <unk>
When I went to this talk, I learned that at 53 percent of 13 girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure turns to 78 percent to the 17.
So the last question that people ask me is: How is life of an model?
And I think the answer that you expect to be, if you're a little bit thinner and you have the brightest hair, you'll feel very happy and cute.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe you can see it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible power to work with creative people, smart people.
And that's all right, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I have never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about my appearance every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, with some legs faster and the brighter hair will be more happy?
They only have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most bright legs, the brighter hair and the <unk> <unk> but it's probably the women physically <unk> on the planet.
But especially it was difficult to look at a situation of race and gender and gender when I am one of the greatest <unk>
If there is something that we have in this talk, I hope that everyone is more comfortable by recognizing the power of the image in the perception of success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since it was enough enough to hold a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 <unk> pictures -- I didn't go to me who owns them.
There was no offensive <unk> no opportunity to repeat the pictures, not even a minimum of <unk>
In fact, most of them took tourists opposed to random.
My story starts when, <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife pulled me this photo holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of <unk> and five.
He gave the fact that we went back to New York just a year later, so we decided to pull the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When the third birthday of my daughter, my wife said to me, why don't you take me back to New York on a <unk> journey, and you continue the <unk>
So this is when we started asking the tourists who were going to take us out of the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has never been denied and, fortunately, no one has been <unk> with the camera.
And so we weren't aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became something sacred to us.
This photo is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day that a five year-old girl could understand.
These pictures are much more than a concrete moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop time on a week in October and to make us reflect on our time and our evolution over the years, and not only at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, even though we always took the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter gets new <unk> and I can see the life through their eyes and how to perceive it and interact with everything.
That particular time we spend together is something we hope with illusion all year.
And so recently, in one of the travel, we were going to walk, when suddenly, it was stopped in the dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the dolls of dolls that <unk> from small in the previous <unk>
And he described what it had felt at the five years of foot at that same place.
<unk> who remembered their heart <unk> with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what he looks at in New York City, because he's determined to study in New York City.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we create are the memories.
So I want to share the idea of being active in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but besides 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one that brings out the photo.
So today, I want to encourage everyone to come up in the picture, and they didn't get them to come up with someone and asked, is it getting a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
The <unk> are found in the most controversial group.
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
It also has been associated with Disney <unk> <unk> <unk> characters as stupid characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press and laughter, applause and <unk> these are the attributes that associate with Parliament <unk> but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep clean the environment --  The <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   You're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.
There are the <unk> of the New World which are mostly in <unk> like <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we have 16 species of these 16, 11 face a high risk of extinction.
So why <unk> are important -- first of all, they provide ecological services and vital services.
They're our <unk>
They need the cadavers to bone.
They help kill all the bacteria. They help to absorb the anthrax that they were not going to spread and caused large losses of livestock and disease in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the cadavers take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of the spread of disease.
<unk> also have enormous <unk>
They've been associated with the ancient <unk> culture.
<unk> was the symbol of license and maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between <unk> and under Egypt.
In the mythology of <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> <unk> of 10 shrunken heads.
In the <unk> culture, they do some very important <unk> to open sky in places like Tibet, there is no place to bury the dead or wood to <unk> so that these <unk> provide a natural disposal system.
What's the problem with the <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, in which six are extremely <unk>
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason they're being <unk> is because there are conflict between humans and <unk> communities are using this venom against the predators, and as a result, <unk> are victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the critical list of extinction, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years ago, and the reason is because they fall prey out of <unk> consumption that has been treated with a drug <unk> like the <unk>
This drug has been banned for veterinary use in India and have taken a statement.
Because there's no <unk> there's been a spread at the number of <unk> dogs in <unk> and when you have dogs <unk> you have a huge amount of time bomb to <unk> The number of failure has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind parks in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up the top of Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments because the wind turbines does this to the birds. They cut it in half.
They're <unk> of birds.
In Western Africa, there is a horrible trade of <unk> dead for serving the <unk> and the <unk> market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're looking at these birds. We are <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so to focus on an alternative problem is not going to be at all.
We need to work with governments at <unk> levels.
We're working with the local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and services that we have.
How can you help? It can become assets, to be active -- you can write a letter to your government and tell you we have to focus on these very narrow <unk> creatures.
When you go out of this room, you would tell you about <unk> but talk to your families, with your children, with your neighbors on the <unk>
They're very <unk> Charles Darwin said it changed because he saw them fly without effort, without energy cost.
And Kenya, this world, will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do -- my life -- my life has been <unk> for seven years of work for my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young people, but I'm not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Costa <unk> Coast, and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
<unk> to the 21, that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
And instead of that, everything that we had to do -- the whole thing we do.
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> of the <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided to teach people from Zambia to grow food.
So we got the seeds of the <unk> the south of Zambia.
Of course, the people were not at all interested in doing that, so that they would give them to come to work to work, and sometimes they were not <unk>  We were convinced that the local people, in such <unk> valley, they hadn't had agriculture.
And yet, instead of asking you how it was possible that you didn't think of anything, we just said, "Thank God that we are here."  It will be <unk> to save the people from Zambia.
And of course, everything in Africa was grown <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a <unk> could grow this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were telling the <unk> "Look at the <unk>
When tomatoes were <unk> <unk> and red in the night in the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything.  And we said, "My God, my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yeah, that's why we don't have agriculture here."
I thought only for us that we only were Italians <unk> mistakes in Africa, but then, I saw what the Americans, what the English would do and then see what they were doing, I was pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you see, at least we feed the <unk>
You can see the <unk> --  <unk> looking at the waste that we gave them to the <unk> people in Africa.
She wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors -- we've given the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the damage that money has <unk>
They just read their book.
It was part of an African woman -- the damage we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> an organizer, and we treat people just two things: or the <unk> or we are <unk>
The two words come from the Latin root <unk> which means <unk>
However, they mean two different things.
<unk> I deal with any of a different culture as if I were my children, I want a lot of a lot.
<unk> I deal with all of a different culture as if they were my <unk>
That's why whites in Africa are called <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face, the little one is <unk> written by <unk> who said over all of economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk> alone.
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman that opened this conference put on the ground and said, we can -- you can -- you can imagine a city that is not <unk>
I decided to have the 27 years to respond to people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never starts anything, you never drives anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of the local passion, the <unk> of the local people, who have a dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you do? It <unk>
It never comes to a community with an idea, and it feels like the people of the <unk>
We don't work from the offices.
We sat up in a coffee.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is going to do you?
The passion that she has for their own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for their own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we helped them find knowledge because no one in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not we, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not for once, but not in <unk>
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with the community meetings.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never tell you, in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what have they identified.
So, planning has this point blind.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know it, because they don't go to their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face-to-face face, you have to create a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You must create a new profession.
The profession is the family doctor of the company, the family doctor -- who sets up with you in your house, at the table of your kitchen, and that helps you find the resources to transform its passion in a way of a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of Western Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. at the time, trying to get away from this condescending garbage that we came to tell you what to do.
Within a year, I had 27 projects going on, and the government came to me to see the question: "How can you do that?
How do you do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very hard.
And --  --  --  So --    So --  So --  So --  So --  So --  So --  So --  --  So the government says, <unk> <unk>  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped them start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business <unk> of the story, passed into '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a company of company <unk>
<unk> is the kiss of the death of the death of the spirit.
So now we <unk> <unk> <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come to talk to you.
You have to <unk> you have to say, privacy, it has to be fantastic to the <unk> and then you have to come back, will come in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 clients.
You can imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What is you going to show you about this morning, right?
<unk> local people. That's what you have <unk>
So what I tell you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution -- <unk> fossils and one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a form of sustaining <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> we can communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution -- <unk> <unk>
The government?
They will be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a beautiful story that was in a futuristic magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to discuss the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the <unk> year, it came together this group of people, and <unk> about what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> the city of New York City would not exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve, and they <unk> if the population keeps growing up to this <unk> to move the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses -- would be impossible to <unk>
They were already <unk> --  So in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> the life of New York City.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States appeared <unk> generic generic companies <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few factories -- <unk> factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan. It was Henry Ford.
However, there's a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First of all, you have to offer you <unk>
Otherwise, they're not going to talk with you.
Then you have to give you an absolute <unk> a dedicated <unk>
And then you have to tell you the truth with respect to <unk>
The smaller company, the bigger company, the bigger company, it has to be able to sell three things: the product you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to tell you with a fantastic <unk> and you have to tell you with a great financial administration.
Do you know what?
We have never met a single human being in the world that can do, sell and look for the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
And we've looked at the last 100 companies, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all new companies, Google, <unk>
There's only one thing that all of the successful companies in the world have in common, only one: None of it was started by one person.
Never the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when they began.
Nobody starts a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business of <unk> business in <unk> with their dedicated <unk> who will do for you, what somebody did for you, what somebody did for this <unk> somebody who asked you, what would you need?
What can you do? Can you do it?
Well, you can see it, you can see the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that."
We activate communities.
Thank you.
The people around us can help us for many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't think a lot of knowledge despite the same public spaces.
Over the last few years I've tried to share more with my neighbors in public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and ask more things without calling the door in a bad moment?
How do you share more memories of our abandoned buildings and understand better than our <unk>
How do we share more our hopes for empty stores so that our communities can reflect our needs and <unk>
I live in New York, and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant <unk> that give shadow to <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
It always gives rise to the music --  there's a <unk> in New York --  The city has one of the most beautiful architectures in the world, but also one with the most abandoned property properties.
I live around this house and thought about how it could turn it into a more nice space for the neighborhood and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother for <unk>
His death was sudden and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and <unk>
And it made me a deep gratitude for the time of living and lived on it.
He gave the most significant things in my life today.
But I'm going to take you to keep this look in my daily lives.
I think it's easy to be easy to catch up by day and forget the really important thing for you.
So with the help of old and new friends turned the wall of this abandoned house on a giant slate and he painted on her phrases to <unk> Before they die <unk>
So the <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in the public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was full and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before they die I want to be <unk>  Before they die I want to sit on the line of <unk>
Before I die I want to sing for millions of people."
Before I die I want to plant a <unk>
Before I die I want to live outside the <unk>
Before I die I want to get it once more."
Before I die I want to go to the Treasure rescue.
Before I die I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and hopes of people made me laugh at <unk> and they gave me comfort in hard times.
It's about to know that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways, new and <unk> -- it's about giving to accommodate the reflection and <unk> and remembering what is most important for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and I started to get hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues of the civic center, we made a kit and now they've made walls in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we demonstrated the power of our public spaces if you give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share one another.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of distractions increase, it's more important than ever, to find the ways to preserve the perspective and remember that life is very short and delicate life.
The death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that we would prepare for death is one of those things that will give us more power.
And if you think about death and your life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better than us as individuals and as a community and more media for sharing hopes, and more media for the people around us cannot only help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Today, I have a single request.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> is 22 years old, it's very hot.
And not speech, but it transmits joy that some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
<unk> <unk> happen what happens.
It's not <unk> It doesn't look at the color of the skin.
They don't care about religious differences, and notice this is never <unk>
When singing songs from our childhood, trying to say the words that I can't even be able to <unk> it reminds me of one thing: The little thing that we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. She's very hot.
You would have the most <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if you stole my <unk> but you remember the year that I came out every of the songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four, and I stood up in my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady birthday.
They don't seem like amazing?
But most people don't agree with it.
And in fact, because your minds don't fit into the concept of the society, it's often <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, even if you wouldn't consider them within it, that could only mean one thing: they were <unk> they're autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> is a complex brain disorder that affects social communication and learning sometimes physical skills.
In each individual it manifests itself in a different way, that <unk> is so different from Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, is being diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the development disorders that faster in the world, there is no cause no <unk>
I don't remember my first meeting with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I was just three years ago when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new self in my life.
When a few months, I realized that he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and actually not seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived and <unk> in his own world, with their own rules, and I found pleasure in the smaller things, like putting cars in row around the room, looking at the washing machine and eating anything that would be <unk>
As I grew up, it got more different, and the differences were made more evident.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> an sheer nature and innocent nature, a child who saw the world without <unk> a human being that there was never <unk>
Extraordinary.
I can't deny that there has been some difficult moments in my family, moments in which I wish they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize that these are things that I wouldn't want to change by normal.
<unk> passes the beauty that gives us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that any one is wrong.
It just means there's a different vision of what is right.
If I could give them a single thing to <unk> and Sam and to you, it would be that they don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, they're autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> each one of us has a gift on their inner and, honestly, the pursuit of normal is the last harm of the potential.
The opportunity for the <unk> the progress and the change dies at the time we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what has been being <unk> in the country of <unk>
Penn State asked me to me, a communications teacher that gave a kind of communication to engineering.
I was scared.  And I was scared.  And I was really afraid.
But when those conversations were done -- I felt what they had, must have felt when he fell down the hole in the rabbit and saw the door of a new world.
Just like that I felt when I had those conversations with the students that they had, and I wanted other ideas to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to opening that door is a great communication.
We desperately need a huge communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our greatest challenges -- from energy to the environment and health care -- and if we don't know about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as we don't have these interactions.
But these great conversations may not happen if our engineers and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please, with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that your science is sexy and your engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
You don't just tell us that you study the <unk> but you study the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat <unk>
And when they're describing their science, they care about <unk>
<unk> is an obstacle to our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same thing to make them dumb ones.
On the contrary, as Einstein said, that everything is as simple as possible, but it's not simple.
They can communicate clearly their science without engaging the ideas.
And one thing to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies -- these are ways of hooking and <unk> with their content.
And when you present their work, forget about the signs of <unk>
Have you been asked by why they're called <unk>  What do they do the <unk> and the bullets are killed, and they are killed by their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not only boring, but that it's too boring, but that it's very much in the area of the language of our brains and <unk>
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of the <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the unique design of the <unk> <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple <unk> <unk> that the public can understand if you lose a little bit, and then you can provide graphs that you would stick with our other senses, and create a deeper sense of understanding what you're going on.
I think these are just some key ones that can help others, and see the country of wonders which is science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when you have solved this equation, by all media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all of the Oxford English words is <unk>
Just because it sounds very good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was a <unk> editor of the 19th century that the defined very much better when he said, "A <unk> is that he looks for a public charge without whether or that when he wins, gets it for the mere <unk> of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
One thing to do with the words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the base of politics, and that all the politicians know that they have to try to dominate the language.
It was not <unk> for example, that the British Parliament allowed the newspapers to quote the exact words the exact words were said in the <unk> camera.
And all of this was because of the courage of a guy with the old name of <unk> <unk> who was confronted with the police.
He was thrown in the Tower of London and he <unk> but he had enough courage to deal with them, and at the end he had a popular support in London that I won.
And just a few years later, we had the first recorded use of the phrase <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most of them think it's <unk>
It's not. It's for a advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to America, just after independence.
So, they had to address the question of how to call George Washington Washington, his leader.
Didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a <unk> country.
This is <unk> in Congress for a very long time.
They got all kinds of suggestions that could be <unk>
Some of you wanted to call it a <unk> state and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the <unk> of the American <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was tried to be tested quality.
And not even with it was <unk> they had the idea that you could be chosen for King for a given term there.
And I could have <unk>
The whole world has been tired -- because this debate went down for three weeks.
I read the newspaper of a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and <unk> was that the House of Representatives were against the <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to be made of power.
They didn't want to call it King for him or he would give him a little ideas.
So they wanted to give the title more <unk> more <unk> and more unfortunate than it was happened.
And that title was <unk>
President. You didn't invent the title. There was only before before, but it only meant <unk> which was <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have a lot more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were chairs from small <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it really was a <unk> title.
And so the Senate is <unk>
They said, "is ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
This guy has to sign treated and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who will take in serious with a degree as ridiculous and <unk> like President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't exist.
We can learn three interesting things about all of this.
First of all, and this is my favorite, until I have been able to figure out the Senate has never been <unk> for the President.
President Barack Obama is lucky to follow there, waiting for the Senate between action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible for us to keep it waiting for the extra years to go.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and this is the most important thing, and I want to tell you, is that the title of President of the United States doesn't sound at all so modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear heads at disposal, the largest economy in the world and a motor motor vehicles and so on.
The reality and history have endowed with the title of <unk>
So at the end, I won the <unk>
They got their title of <unk>
And also the other concern in the Senate, the appearance of it -- well, it was a uniqueness for then.
But you know how many nations they have now <unk>
And everything because they want to sound like the guy that has the 5,000 nuclear heads and so on.
So, at the end of the Senate the Senate won and the House of Representatives <unk> because no one is going to feel humble when you tell them that now are President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and what I would like to do with you.
Politicians are trying to choose and use words to shape and control the reality, but actually change reality change much more words than what they could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to under the ground in an illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is loaded with heat and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of body bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that speak but, above all, that cacophony of <unk> male and rocks and <unk> <unk> tools.
Like the others, I have a cheap flash of light, it holds my head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that <unk> hole that falls down to hundreds of meters on the ground.
And I came up with my hand, and suddenly I remember a <unk> that I met days before I had lost control and fell down to <unk>
While I talk to you today, these men are deep in the deep hole in their lives without pay, and often they dying.
And I went out of that hole and went home but they may never be doing it because they're prey to slavery.
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in more than 70 countries on six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the <unk>
Among all the amazing people I met there I met a <unk> <unk> the <unk> an NGO who has been engaged to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about the slavery and, really, I started to learn about slavery because I knew that there was in the world but not to just like that.
When we finished talking to me, I was very thinking, honestly I was going to try to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me a stomach <unk> and weeks later, I flew Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
I started my trip to modern slavery.
Interestingly, it had been in many of these places.
Some of them even considered my second home.
But this time, <unk> the dirty ones.
A conservative calculation says that there are more than 27 million people in the world.
It's twice as much African Africans throughout the whole aspect of slaves <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer slave, was about three times the annual wage of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of about 50,000 <unk> today.
And yet, today, we can save entire families by generations per debt of 18.
<unk> <unk> profit from over 13 billion dollars a year all over the world.
Many have been <unk> with false promise of good education and better education to then discover that they are forced to work without pay, under violence and cannot escape.
Today, slavery operates in the <unk> the goods produced by slaves have value, but those who produce them are disposable them.
<unk> exists all over the world and yet, it's illegal throughout the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This strange show and formidable show was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> at a temperature of 54 degrees C, men, women, kids, in fact, entire families -- <unk> <unk> <unk> bricks in their heads until 18 at the time, and they take them from the <unk> <unk> to trucks that are at a hundred meters.
And <unk> for the <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task over and over again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no time to eat, no to drink, and the severe <unk> I had to pee out was quite <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot, and he stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean the equipment and make it work with air conditioning for <unk> and, sitting there, I was thinking, my camera gets a much better treatment than these people.
Back in the furnaces I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was very quickly grabbed me and said to me, <unk> Don't do it. Don't do it here."
And he explained so clearly that to prove emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't give you any direct help.
I couldn't give them money, anything.
I wasn't citizen of that country.
It could put them in a worse situation that they already were.
I had to trust the <unk> the <unk> and work within the system for his release and trusted that he <unk>
As soon as I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas in the Himalayas I found kids carrying rocks for miles per <unk> to the trucks that were waiting down.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the children who would charge and children put them on their heads with <unk> <unk> <unk> strings and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something that <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they're slaves and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been all of his life.
They don't have anything to <unk>
When these villagers <unk> his freedom, they had completely lost their homes.
When we hear the word slavery often we are often thinking about sexual trafficking, and because of this global consciousness, I advised me to be hard for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously <unk>
I was driven by a <unk> stairs, which gave this basement <unk> <unk> light, light.
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was more like a restaurant.
<unk> as it is known in the craft, they are local for prostitution in education.
They have small, private rooms, where they <unk> them with their girls and children, some of them just seven years -- are forced to entertain clients and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Every single <unk> and <unk> <unk> identified by a <unk> number on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse their clients.
On the <unk> I remember a sense of <unk> <unk> and in that moment, I could barely imagine what it should be stuck in that hell.
He just had a <unk> the stairs where they <unk>
There was no doors.
There was no windows -- big enough for <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, because we touch a very difficult issue, it's important to point that slavery, even sexual traffic is happening around us.
There are hundreds of people <unk> in agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 children are sold every year as sex.
It is everywhere, but we don't see it.
The textiles are another activity that often relate to the labor of <unk>
I went to Indian villages where there were entire families on the retail of the silk trade.
This is a family portrait of family.
<unk> black hands are the father, the <unk> of blue and red, of their children.
<unk> <unk> in these great barrels and pour the silk into the liquid to the <unk> but the <unk> is <unk>
My translator told me his stories.
We don't have <unk> they said.
We still have to be able to go out of this house someday and go to another place where our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children in Lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we got there, I went to a quick look at it.
I saw what it seemed like to be a <unk> family in a boat, two younger siblings -- some younger kids -- it makes sense, right?
<unk> They were all slaves.
The children are separated from their <unk> families and they were forced to work extensively long in these boats on the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This child has eight years old.
When our boat came up to it was <unk> that his little canoe was <unk>
He was paralyzed by the fear of falling in the water.
The <unk> branches of trees submerged in Lake <unk> often trap networks and children, <unk> and fear, they get thrown into the water to unlock the branches.
A lot of <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work in the lake.
Because of the fear of his love is not going to flee and like all the life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> tries to the younger slaves under their command.
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning, when they were doing the last networks, but they had been working from one another.
It was in the cold night and <unk>
And it would be able to point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a refuge in which he <unk> the <unk> <unk> victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes as possible.
Who will come to be because someone decided to make the difference in their life?
<unk> for a road in Ghana with the <unk> a fellow <unk> with their <unk> suddenly accelerated and <unk> our car and played the window.
He asked us to put it on a road to the jungle.
At the end of the road, we would love to get out of the car, and he asked the driver that it came out very quickly.
And then it pointed out to signal this path barely visible and said, "This is the path, this is the road.
As we started going, we took the <unk> that <unk> the way and after walking close to an hour we found that the way I was going on with the recent <unk> so I put the photos of photos on my head as it was <unk> in these water to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the way I ended up <unk> in an clear, and we had a mass of holes that could fit into a soccer field, and they were all full of <unk> workers.
A lot of women had children tied to their backs and, while they were looking for gold, <unk> in <unk> waters with <unk>
The mercury is used in the <unk> process.
These miners are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the pump they were <unk> in their own sweat.
I remember watching his eyes tired, <unk> given that many had been under land for 72 hours.
The pits have to be 90 feet and these people are carrying heavy heavy bags which then will be shipped back to another area where they <unk> the stone to get the gold.
In the first view, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if we look closer to the edge of the margin we see the other lucky ones and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> will end up like this victim of T.B. and <unk> for mercury in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died, he took him to work with him in mines.
When he died, their uncle, he <unk> by the debt of the uncle who force it to be a slave in the mines.
When I met him, he had worked on mines in 14 years and the leg injury that you see here is a product of an accident in the <unk> so serious that the doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet it's forced to work night and day on that mine.
Yet, he dreams with being released and educated with local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, from face to an remote, which inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to shine light on slavery.
Did you know that your images would be seen for you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we will give witness to them, and we will do everything possible to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see ourselves some of us as human beings, then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not from magazines. They're from people, real people, like you and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no one day that I don't think about these so many beautiful people, <unk> that I've had the great honor to meet.
I hope that these images show a force in the people who see them in people like you, and I hope that that force turn on a fire and that that fire will light over the slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do applied math and there is a peculiar problem for whom the <unk> are like management jobs.
No one knows what the hell we do.
So today, I want to try to explain to you what I do.
<unk> is one of the most human activities.
We would give us the <unk> of the heavens and the dancers of <unk>  that we'll see that we'll see later.
But the presence of the demand for a degree of extraordinary training. a high level of dexterity -- and probably some initial <unk> that can well have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, the neurological disorders like Parkinson's Parkinson's disease gradually -- this extraordinary ability, as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, at his age was a ballet ballet ballet dancer who, at the time.
Over the last few years has been done a lot about treatment.
However, there are <unk> millions of people in the world that are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> they have <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need tools to be able to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure the progress in an objective and ultimately the only way we know if there really is a cure to be when we have an objective measure and <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of movement has no biological markers, which is why they don't serve blood analysis and the best we have is a neurological test.
You have to go to a clinic doing it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that outside the clinical trials, they never do.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a <unk> trip to the clinic. What if patients could do the exam they ourselves?
You wouldn't need personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to do -- as a very conventional <unk> form of a chance, you see, in a certain sense at least we are all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of the <unk>
It shows someone healthy while it gives sound to talk, and we can imagine as dancers of a vocal ballet because we need to coordinate all of those vocal organs to produce sounds and all of the genes need to be needed -- the <unk> for example.
And as they did, it requires an extraordinary training level.
Let's think about the time that leads to a child learning to speak.
From the sound, we can track the position of vocal cords as we <unk> and as a Parkinson's disease affects the <unk> also affects the organs.
On the bottom angle, you can see an example.
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you contrast these exams based on the voice with the <unk> clinical trials -- well, both of them are not <unk>
<unk> is not <unk> they're both using existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to make them.
Both are <unk> OK, but in addition to the <unk> tests are not <unk>
I mean, you can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds a lot.
They're the minimum of minimum and we all know what happens is happening.
When something takes a massive <unk> it shows you at a massive scale.
These are some amazing lists to <unk>
We can reduce the <unk> <unk>
You don't need to go to the clinic for the <unk>
<unk> regularly we could get objective data.
We could make <unk> <unk> <unk> for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at the overall scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So when I give you the first steps in that sense, we're launching the Initiative <unk>
Together with <unk> and <unk> we want to record a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start addressing these goals.
We have local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with no Parkinson's or <unk> can be able to call low price and put recordings for a couple of cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've already reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
So thank you.   Tom Rielly: So <unk> taking all of these samples of, let's say 10,000 people, you can say who's healthy and who doesn't?
What will you take from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate whether you have or not the disease. TR: Sure.
<unk> You can see, some people may not <unk> You may not get it.
But we're going to get a very large array of <unk> data in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances -- it's important because we are looking at <unk> the confusion factors in pursuit of the actual markers of the disease.
TR: You have a <unk> of accuracy at this moment?
<unk> Much more than that.
In fact, my graduate student, I have to <unk> it has done fantastic work, and now has shown that it works in the mobile telephony network also, what we put the project, and now we have a 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max public <unk>
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March from 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We are creatures.
We were concerned about the dark in rooms.
We do the role models even more <unk> the perfect <unk> -- the perfect <unk> we do as much as we can, and we have a few of us in the press all the time, but some of us are actually artists with talent with many years of experience and a real taste for the images and the photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were going on in Japan.
Shortly after, an organization where I was <unk> there were <unk> -- was in the place working as part of the answer.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew that we couldn't stay sitting home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May 13 of May I traveled to <unk>
It's a little <unk> village in the <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first villages affected by the wave.
The measured water level reaches over 24 feet tall and more than three miles in land.
As you can imagine, the people were <unk>
It would take off the rubble of channels and <unk>
<unk> schools. We took the mud and we leave it ready to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of dead fish -- <unk> <unk> of the local factory.
We love it and they loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like the neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> photos and cards and cards.
Everybody did the same thing.
They took them and take them to different places of all around the peoples of all around them.
It wasn't until so I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
While they were fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to abandon absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week, I started to help a <unk> center of the village.
It helped clean toilets the enormous, gigantic <unk>
This place turned out to be the place in the village where the <unk> center, the photos.
I had the honor and the honor of that day <unk> in me to clean the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, I had heard the expression beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until it was my horizons that something happened.
By looking at the pictures, I found some that had more than a hundred years before, and I couldn't avoid thinking like <unk> how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I entered Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive and I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too much <unk> but where the water had taken up, the face of the girl was supposed to be a lot of precision and <unk>
Otherwise that little girl would not have the aspect of it, and that would be as tragic as you have the photo <unk>
At the time of time, they got the more pictures and they got more <unk> so it went into Facebook and <unk> and five days later, 80 people from 12 countries volunteered to help.
Within two weeks I had 150 people who had <unk>
In Japan, in July, we were <unk> to <unk> a village in the north of <unk>
Once a week we use our scanner in the time ownership libraries that had been <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that <unk> in <unk> is a different story: depended on the <unk> of the photos.
It could be <unk> it could be <unk>
It could be <unk>
This <unk> had to draw on hand as a guide in the areas whose color and detail, was not destroyed.
It took a long time.
The water destroyed all these photographs of water would be <unk> with algae -- with algae, and even the whole step along with the time time I continue <unk> it was an important part of the project.
We couldn't afford the picture unless it was clean up, dry and had been replaced by his <unk>
We were lucky with <unk>
We have a <unk> on a <unk>
It's very easy to harm the photos even more <unk>
As I once said that, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was lucky in relation to the photos.
And I had started <unk> she was stopped to realize that it was even more.
He also had <unk>
Without them, the images of their husband and their own face was not been able to reconstruct it, we were able to put the images into one photo and put it on the whole picture.
When they picked his pictures that he shared some of his history with us.
Some colleagues in his husband found pictures in a fire Station between the rubble quite far away from where he used to be his house, but his colleagues did it.
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water while the <unk> <unk>
Their little children, not so small now, but their two children were at school, in different schools.
One of them was stuck in the water.
He took him a week to find his family and know that they all had survived.
The day he gave her pictures his son was 14 years old.
For her, despite all this, these pictures were the best gift that he could do, something that he could remember the past that he could remember the past day of March when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined there, hundreds of them helped us clean hands more than <unk> photographs, the great majority of <unk> -- the great majority came in their hands of their <unk>
More than 500 volunteers all over the world helped us back to 90 families hundreds of full photos and <unk>
During this time, we don't really spend more than 1,000 dollars in teams and materials, most of the ink for <unk>
We take pictures constantly.
A photo is a memory of somebody or something, a relationship, a person loved.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing we would take for us, but the first thing that we would look for.
So this was the project, to restore little pieces of mankind, to bring it back to someone their connection with the past.
When a picture like this would give someone, a huge difference in the life of the person that receives you.
This project also made a huge difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected to something bigger -- I'll give you something, using your talent to something that is not very thin skin of perfect skin.
And so I would like to read this email -- I sent him Cindy the day I came back from Japan after six months.
While they were <unk> I couldn't avoid thinking about the people and the stories shown in the pictures.
One in particular, a photo with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small girl, gathered around a baby, <unk> because a little bit of my family my grandmother, my mother, and my daughter was just <unk> hanging from our wall.
In the whole world, in the whole world, all our basic needs are themselves, right?
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> inspired us wonder and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that passed an apple on a billionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not to a million or a billion or a billion frames per second.
I present you a new kind of <unk> the <unk> a new technique so fast that you can create videos in slow motion.
And so we can create cameras that can see behind the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see the interior of the body without using X-rays, and really challenging the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and I turned it up and <unk> it in a second <unk> or it is in a number of <unk> to create a <unk> package just one millimeter <unk>
And that <unk> package and that <unk> will travel at the speed of light, and, again, a million times faster than a common bullet that a common bullet does.
If we take that bullet and this <unk> package and <unk> in this bottle, how do they disperse these photons into this <unk>
What is the light aspect of the light in <unk>
Now, all of this --   -- remember, all of this happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see the light in motion.
Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola didn't take this research --   -- so many things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what is going on.
The pulse, our <unk> goes into the bottle with a <unk> package that starts to <unk> and that, inside, starts to <unk>
Part of the light is <unk> goes to the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
A lot of the photons get to the lid and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's an air bubble that bounces inside.
At that time, the waves travel down the table and because of the <unk> of the top of the <unk> you see at the bottom of the bottle, after a number of pictures, which is <unk>
Now, if we take a common and current bullet and we make it run the same distance and we see it on a slow camera to about 10 billion times, how much people think it would take us sitting down to see that film?
One day?
It would be a very boring film --  of a slow <unk>
And what about how about <unk> nature.
You can see the waves that are <unk> from the table and the <unk> wall.
It's like throwing a rock on a pond.
It's the way that nature paints a picture, I was thinking, a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full composition of it.
But if you look at a more time when you look at this <unk> you realize that, as the light <unk> of the <unk> it's brilliant. You don't get away.
Why? Because the <unk> is <unk> and the light bounces on its inside and it goes back after various <unk> a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your mobile phone, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check if the fruit is grown without having to get it.
What do we create this camera at MIT?
As photographers, you know, if we take a photo at the low exhibition, it gets very little light.
But we're going to go a billion times faster than the most short, so you just get into some light.
We sent that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those data <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data into raw data and make it interesting ways.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible, too.
And if a new power of a future <unk> would allow him to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door. I get into the room, a part is going to reflect on the gate, and from there to the camera, to the camera.
We could extract those multiple light <unk>
It's not science fiction. We already built.
On the left, it's our <unk>
Behind the wall there is a <unk> and <unk> the light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And it's a tiny fraction of the photons going back to the camera but interestingly, in some slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works so quickly, our <unk> has unique skills.
It has very good <unk> and you can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door and also the hidden objects, but we don't know what dot corresponds to how distance.
When you project a laser you can record a picture of a raw, which, you see on the screen, it doesn't really make any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, the <unk> and we will try to look at all the various <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the <unk> object.
Can we see it <unk>
This is our heritage.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that will be collisions with what is around the curve, the <unk>
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions looking at the light reflected by the open windows.
Or we could build <unk> capable of looking at the inside of the body through <unk> and the same for <unk>
But of course, because of the fabric and the blood is quite hard, so really, this is an order for scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new section modality to solve the problems of science in the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> he was a scientist, I became the science of art, an art of photographs of photography.
I realized that all the <unk> data that we collect every time is not just scientific visualization, but we can see them.
It will create a new form of computational photography, with slow motion and color code.
And let's look at those <unk> Remember, the time between each one of those waves is just a <unk> of a second.
But this is also something fun.
If you look at the waves underneath the <unk> you go away from us.
The waves should be moving towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have weird effects -- Einstein would have loved to see this image.
The order in which the events in the world are sometimes invested in the camera.
<unk> the corresponding warping of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hi there. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile cell can get your life, and you give you freedom freedom.
With a mobile mobile phone, a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a mobile phone, you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a mobile phone, you can record a song to move it up and get famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and I live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment to this city.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people were <unk> in search of a change.
This is the fall of 1989. So imagine if all of these people gathered in that room is looking for a change, they had a mobile phone in our pocket.
Who would have a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Hands up your cell phones.
<unk> A Android, an wow!
It's a lot. Almost all of you today have a mobile phone.
But today I'm talking about my mobile phone, and how life changed my life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
<unk>
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006 the Commission of the E.U. presented a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This guy says that every <unk> telephone company, every single Internet monopoly on Europe, has to store a wide range of information from the users.
Who calls who. Who sends an email to who.
Who's sent a text to who.
And if we use the mobile phone, where we are.
All this information is stored for at least six months, and until two years, in their telephone company, or their Internet provider or the Internet.
And in all Europe people were planted and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this retention of data.
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the carriers and the Internet providers, all this information about us.
There was lawyers, journalists, they all said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10,000 people that came out to the streets of Berlin and said, <unk> not <unk>
And some even said that this would be, 2.0.
<unk> was the secret police of Eastern Asia.
And I also asked me if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use the <unk>
So I asked my phone phone -- <unk> <unk> who at that time was the largest telephone company in Germany, which is for me, all the information I had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to asking them and I didn't get a concrete response, it was all blah.
But then I said, "I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to take a demand for court because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we won't give this information.
At the end of it, he <unk> a agreement.
Would we take the demand and they send me the information that I <unk>
As the Veterans' Court <unk> I failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly <unk> with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand percent, 30 percent of information.
I saw them and said, well, it's a huge file. Okay.
But after a while, I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this file.
It was a little <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I step at night, what am I doing.
But then I said, I want this information to happen.
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the retention of data.
So, next to <unk> <unk> and Open Data comes City, we did this.
This is a six months of my life.
You can zoom in and go, go backwards and forward.
You can see every step I do.
And you can see how I go from <unk> to <unk> and what often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives a little scary.
But it's not only about me.
It's about all of us.
First of all, there are things like, I call my wife and she's called, talking a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they call it between them.
And then one calls the other, and the other one to another, and we end up with this huge communication network.
You can see how your people communicate with each other to what time they call each other, what time they sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who's talking to whom, who sends an email to whom, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and until two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets in Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a mobile phone in our pocket.
And the <unk> had known who was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders, this would never happen to happen.
The fall of the Berlin Wall is probably never happened.
And as a result, neither of the <unk> of <unk>
Because today the state agencies and business agencies want to store as much information from us as possible.
They want to have the possibility to follow our lives and they want to go ahead of them forever.
But the <unk> and living in the digital age, is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for the <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When they come home home to their friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and it's not in the middle of fashion.
When they go home, they would take their representative of their representative because the companies and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information information is.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones to remind you that you have to fight for the <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hi <unk> what happens?
It's not enough.
Hi <unk> what happens?
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor who brought me to the world.
I went to my mom six times in six different directions, <unk> the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, so it <unk> all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mix of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
<unk> P. <unk> is not genetics.
It's not <unk> you can't afford it.
No one <unk> the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were cousins, while they are.
It's just about accidents, like the one that happened at birth.
Now, I will tell you, I'm not a source of inspiration. And I don't want any of us to stand here.
You feel bad for me, because at some point in life, you wish you would be disabled.
Let's go a ride.
<unk> Christmas are at the shopping mall, they drive in a parking lot and what does it?
16 empty places for disabled.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
In addition, I tell you, I have the 99 problems, and the P. is just one of them.
There was a <unk> of the <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm <unk> Muslim woman, and I live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should do it.
I'm from Park.
I always loved my neighborhood and my disease had the same first principle.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York, I would.
A lot of people with cerebral <unk> but my parents don't believe in <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "Can you have <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three sisters. I <unk>
If my three sisters. I was going to public school, my parents would come to the school system and <unk> that I was also outside, and if we didn't take all the ultimate note -- all of them took the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me to walk at the five years putting my <unk> on his feet and just walking.
Another approach I used to use was to hang a dollar in front of me so that it was <unk>
The <unk> that I carry inside was very strong and so forth.
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten was walking around as a boxing champion that has received many taps.
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arabic, and they continue to be all of the family.  I think no one realized that we were not <unk>
This was prior to 9/11, and the politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to the <unk> as a campaign campaign.
The people that I grew up with didn't have trouble with my faith.
However, it seemed like <unk> so much that died of hunger during the <unk>
I told you that I had enough fat to live three months without eating them, so I read at sunset at sunset is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to the dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whatever I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and I want to be <unk> so if my friends were used <unk> I would too.
And when my friends were <unk> on the summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I wasn't going.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid if we don't go back to Palestine all of the <unk> we would give us into <unk>
On the summer summer vacation I often was <unk> so I was drinking milk from <unk> so I was drinking milk on the back, and I would lie on the <unk> Sea, and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I was thinking, "Are you <unk>
But the <unk> cure was yoga.
I must say that it's very boring, but before you make yoga it was a comedy comedian that I couldn't stand up, let me go.
And now I can put it on the head.
My parents' parents, this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be in the <unk> Hospital.
I went to college through the positive discrimination and I got a fellowship for the <unk> University of the state of Arizona, because it was in all the <unk>
It was like the <unk> of the theater.
All of me <unk> me.
I did all the tasks of the least <unk> I took the ultimate note in my lectures, and also in his classes.
Every time I was doing a scene from the glass Law -- my professors <unk>
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to do a work called <unk> very slow in Jackson.
It's a work of a girl with the brain.
I was a girl with the brain.
So I started screaming at the four <unk> When I finally have a <unk>
I have <unk>
At the end of it. At the end of it.
Thank God <unk> I am <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave it to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running to the law of the theater, crying -- historically, as if someone had killed my cat, asking him why and she told me that I think I couldn't do the <unk>
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the <unk> you can't do the <unk> either.
It was a paper that literally was born and was given to an actor without the brain.
The college was mimicking my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> actors without disability for disabled papers.
And I came home, and I came home, and my first tour tour, it was as extra in a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there like a <unk> I didn't see it more than the <unk> and it was clear to me that directors of <unk> <unk> nonviolent organizations, not white, with disability.
We just got perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up looking at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I made it <unk>
In my first tour, he took me on my first tour, famous of New York to New Jersey, and I'll never forget the face of the first comedian that he took when he fell on the account that he was at high speed on the New Jersey highway with a driver that had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs across the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, without censorship and no veil.
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you never heard that little unpleasant rumor that women are not fun, and they find very fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> <unk> Festival of New York, now in his 10 year.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in media and to remind the directors of <unk> that <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
<unk> to the Arab was much easier to fight against the challenge of the stigma of disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was like invited to the <unk> news program by Keith <unk>
I walked down as if I went to a graduate dance, I was given to a study and sat in a wheelchair.
I looked at the <unk> and I said, <unk> you can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I was clinging to the <unk> desk for not to go out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
At the end, I had my opportunity and the <unk> I knew they wouldn't have me.
But not only Mr. <unk> came back to <unk> but I went down like the full-time <unk> and pasted my chair.
One fun thing that I learned on right now with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
The kids are told that kids are <unk> but they never get away from me and no child and older than me.
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became an object of <unk>
<unk> clips online, like, "Why do you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite, <unk> a terrorist.
What disease is there?
We really should pray for her."
A <unk> suggested even that I would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as the race.
If someone in the wheelchair can't make <unk> then you can make someone in the wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yes, <unk> man. Come on.
<unk> are the largest minority in the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors said I don't know -- but I'm here in front of you.
However, I have grown up with the media, I don't think it was <unk>
I hope that together we can create the most positive images of disability in the media and in everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images -- that <unk> less hatred on the Internet.
Or maybe no.
We may still need the whole society to teach our children.
My <unk> journey has taken me to very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> by the red carpet by the <unk> Susan <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I came to act on a film with Adam <unk> and work with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab <unk> <unk> <unk>
I was <unk> in representation of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I started "The <unk> <unk> a charity to give Syrian refugee kids, a very much part of what my parents were passionate about.
It was the only time my father saw me in alive, and I do this talk to the memory.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
I call myself <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child of a young people.
I don't know his name, but I know his story.
He lives in a small village in the South <unk>
This village is about <unk>
The <unk> <unk> to poverty and the edge of the <unk>
Without him there, it's going to the great city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there is no opportunities, no work, no perspectives of future.
He ended up in a tent, in the city outside <unk>
After maybe a year ago, nothing.
One day you have a guy who gives him to bring it to <unk> after dinner, to <unk>
He meets a dynamic group of people, who gives a break.
It gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes, money to send her home to your family.
They present a young lady.
They finally went home.
It starts a new life.
It has a life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky bursts a bomb.
That child of that little village with dreams of the great city was the <unk> terrorist and that dynamic group of people were <unk> a connected terrorist organization to al Qaeda.
So how do the story of a kid in a small village trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting for it.
I was waiting for an opportunity, waiting for your future, waiting for a future, and this was the first thing that arrived.
This was the first thing that we did about what we call the <unk> period.
And his story repeats across urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young people who <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, who are looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity, of work, but young people are not engaged in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth that suffers from higher rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of every five people living in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if they don't give them opportunities, the history of the <unk> of <unk> the door to terrorism, to violence, to <unk> to be the story of cities 2.0.
And in my city of birth, <unk> 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, it's not going to school.
They do almost nothing.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the <unk> Hospital.
I remember being in front of that hospital <unk> to <unk> thinking, and if I had never gone?
And if I was forced to be forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was at <unk> that month was actually to harbor some youth leaders in a business summit fund.
They took a few 90 African leaders.
We sat around and we had an ideas of ideas about the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no work, no opportunities.
I remember when he said to me, that because it was a graduate college student, a frustrated, was the perfect whites for Al <unk> and other terrorist organizations, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like him.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the greatest obstacle to get from point to B is the street.
<unk> years of civil war, have completely destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle may be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a <unk> company.
He started <unk> motorcycle residents who normally couldn't afford them.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of her family and friends, and his dream is at some time to expand hundreds of <unk> for the next three years.
Why is this story different.
What does this story different?
I think their ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the <unk> spirit and I believe that business spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk>
<unk> young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking for so quickly.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the summit of corporate initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business progress.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in 22 years, and until recently, until Mohamed came, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were sent from plastic from the abroad.
If you give someone, "When was the last time you saw flowers <unk>
For those who grew up during civil war, the answer is: <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> and design.
I created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and he started growing <unk> and <unk> who said, could they survive the hard climate of <unk>
And it started the delivery of flowers for wedding and creating gardens in the houses, and the companies of the city, and now it's working on the creation of the first public park in <unk> in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
He wants to create a space where families, young families, can go together, and, like he says, smell the pink <unk>
By the way, he's not pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO, working for the government, but their story, their innovation, it really had a strong impact on them.
He forced them to look at their city like a place of opportunity.
I encouraged them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that could be <unk>
For the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the major challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So, inspired young people and creating a culture of economic spirit is really a great step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need expertise and orientation to work on development and put it out of their business.
<unk> young people with the resources that they need, we have support that they need to move from understanding to creation, and create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the spirit spirit is something else to start a business.
It's to create a social impact.
Mohamed is not simply selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Their <unk> of the <unk> is how it calls it when he is created, it will transform the way people see their city.
<unk> I hired kids from the street to help rent and keep <unk>
It gave them the opportunity to escape from <unk> <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to turn the young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and eat their <unk> innovation, and they have more stories about flowers and Parks of Peace that <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years and I went to <unk> with my dad in the mountains of <unk> an area north of the state of New York City.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun was able to make the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not to be on the way that we can pretend that we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed of a <unk> on a beautiful <unk> lake when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the shed was a <unk> of about four square meters, with apple hearts -- <unk> balls of paper <unk> and <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy like to pull out what they thought they thought was going to clean their <unk>
That question went on with me, and he would get a little bit embarrassed to it.
Who cleans our <unk>
No matter how you want, or where do you have the <unk> who clean our crap in <unk>
Who cleans our trash in Rio or in Paris or in <unk>
Here in New York, the Department of <unk> clean our trash, and the reason for 11 tons of waste and two tons of <unk> products every day.
I wanted to know that as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What does it feel to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled into the trucks and walked through his pathways, and I interviewed people in the office and facilities in the entire city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed to get more.
So I started working like garbage <unk>
Now I wasn't just traveling in the trucks. I have <unk>
And they operated the mechanics and <unk> the snow bar.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as widespread as you think, and in the days that it's very strong -- you get very strong.
It costs a lot more used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years, and their bodies were still tracking the weight of taking over his tons of garbage all the weeks.
It's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of "We <unk> the waste collection is one of the most dangerous <unk> of the country, and I learned the reason.
You're going out and entering traffic all day and pass <unk> around you.
They just want to ask them, so they just don't pay attention.
That's very bad for <unk>
And also the crap itself is full of dangers that often fall off the truck and cause terrible damage.
I also learned about the relentless of the trash.
When you get out of the <unk> you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that crap is like a force of nature itself.
It's never coming.
It's also like a breathing way or circulation.
It always must be moving.
And it's also the stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is particularly ironic because I believe that the <unk> of waste is the most important labor hand in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They are the first <unk> of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste in the efficient form of efficient and effective every day, this starts to get rid of your container and your dangers inherent to us in very real ways.
So we had been controlled by decades and centuries to come back and start <unk>
The economy needs the economy.
If we can't get rid of the old we don't have room for what the motors of the economy begin to fail when it's in danger the consumption is.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, I just pointed into your relationship.
And then it's what I call our average speed rate necessary.
With that, I mean by just the speed that they used used to move in the contemporary time.
We don't usually blame us, and we cleaned up with us our coffee cup -- our bag of <unk> our water bottle.
We use, the <unk> forget about them, because we know there is a job force on the other side that we would take away from it.
So today, I want to suggest to you a couple of ways to think about waste collection that maybe will help reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable sustainable city.
His work, I think, is almost <unk>
They are in the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in a lot of cities.
Do you know when you were going.
And their work allows us to do our own.
They're almost a kind of relief.
The flow that they keep us left us except for us, our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow has always to stay one way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a <unk> truck on the streets, grabbed my little son, and I went down the stairs, and there was a man making her journey of <unk> of paper like he did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank her for doing his work that particular day, but I started crying.
And he looked at me and he said, "We're going to be okay.
Let's be okay."
Shortly after that, I started looking at waste collection and went back to the man.
It's called <unk> we worked together many times, and we made good friends.
I want to believe that I was right.
Let's be okay.
But in our efforts for <unk> the way we exist on this planet as species, we have to include and have to account at all the costs, even the cost human cost, even the real human cost.
<unk> waste that we think when we talk about trash, they represent three percent of the amount of waste in the nation.
It's a remarkable scenario.
So in the flow of your days and your lives, the next one that you see someone whose work is to clean the crap of you, let me get a moment to <unk>
I have a moment to tell you thank you.
My work is focused on the connection of thinking about our community life, forming a part of the environment where architecture is naturally naturally from conditions and local traditions.
I brought up two recent projects as an example of this.
Both projects are located in the emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis of different perspectives become an essential part of the end of architecture.
So the first example started with an invitation to design a commercially <unk> shopping center.
This is the kind of construction that showed us as example, to my team and me, about what we had to design.
At the beginning, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out <unk>
After looking at some of these buildings there are many in the city, we realized that there are three important aspects that there are three important aspects there.
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to use a lot of energy because the skin <unk> it generates heat into the interior, so it is necessary much <unk>
In a city where this should not happen because it's a temperate climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees across the year.
And thirdly, his view has nothing to do with Africa and Ethiopia.
It's a shame for a very rich place in culture and traditions.
In our first visit, to Ethiopia, I was really enchanted with the old market that is this structure in the air in the air where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to little <unk>
That's also that idea of using the public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that that was what I really wanted to design, not a mall.
But the question was how to build a modern <unk> of various stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to the site of the site, which is located in a much growth area of the city, where much of the buildings that we now see in the image, not there.
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't communicate for a hundred meters.
So the first thing we did was create a connection between these two streets, <unk> all the entries in the building.
And this is spreading from an <unk> <unk> which creates a space in the open air in the building that was <unk> by its own shape of the sun and rain.
And around this space we've applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes on every floor because of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
And I wanted to find a solution that we would bring to the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a tissue like a concrete <unk> <unk> to allow the air to the air, and also the light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons.
They have properties of fractal geometry.
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that leave the air and the light in a controlled way inside the building.
This is <unk> with these little colored crystals that use the inside of the building in the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas didn't be easy to convince the developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center. It was not what they wanted.
But ultimately we all realized that this idea of the market was going to be much more profitable than the mall because in the end of the bank there was more local to sell.
And then the idea of the facade was extremely significant, not only because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have air conditioning.
So we got some savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the power of energy for the building in a city where electricity is short almost every day.
So we get a big advantage by putting it into the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this urban oasis.
And these <unk> on the roof, which are collected water for the <unk>
It's expected for the beginning of the next year, because we go through the fifth floor of the construction.
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartment and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to make a project so large, the biggest thing that I have designed, I needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also to its environment, their tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I put special attention to the <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a dozen <unk> wall of access connected by almost straight lines.
When I went to place, the first design operation that we did was expand existing streets by creating 12 early blocks in size and features that there are in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some of the strategic spots in relation to the idea of <unk> gates with straight lines, and this altered the initial model.
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the little cell cell -- like <unk> as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would the best orientation for an apartment in the climate <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a heat difference between both sides of the house and therefore natural ventilation.
So let's make a framework that claims that most apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks up with <unk> and then in the lower plant, we have all the connections to the pedestrians.
And also answers to local norms that set up a higher density at higher levels and a lower density in the lower plant.
And it also reinforces this doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving the community to the space occupied by construction.
It is where all the neighbors, you can go up and get them up and make activities like running a <unk> race in the morning, or jump from one building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they're in the emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives changes the communities and local economies at the same rate as buildings.
So for this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that the relationship between the community and the environment, and they have as a goal to connect the nature of the people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl joined our class. It was as remarkable as you see all the new girls.
He had huge amounts of very bright hair, and a little <unk> <unk> <unk> was super strong for the capitals of the very good states, very good for <unk>
And I ended up that year and I was full of jealousy, until I got my sinister plan.
One day I got a time after the <unk> was a little afternoon and I hid in the bathroom of girls.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I walked into the classroom, I went from my teacher grades.
And then, I did.
The ratings of my <unk> just a little bit, just a few Like this.
And all the things --  And I had to set up the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other partners had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes across the world, without any imagination.
I put all of them out of <unk> and I'm just a row of it, just because of being there, since I was there.
I'm still surprising to what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I was doing this.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I would never bother me.
It's that everything was <unk>
I never had me.
But most of all, I was struck by the reason why bothered me that this little little girl was so good for <unk>
I mean, jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know babies suffer from jealousy.
Also, the primates. The birds are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of spouses in the United States.
And yet, I've never seen a study that <unk> loneliness, or the long duration or the sadness.
So for that, you have to go to the fiction, because novels are like the lab that we study <unk> in all their possible forms.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there were no enough, it would be literature.
Well, I didn't have <unk> I wouldn't have <unk>
There would be no king <unk> or <unk> and <unk>
I didn't have Shakespeare.
I read the lists of reading reading from high school, because we'd be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would not have <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk>
There's no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and as soon as they have them all of them.
This year they get a hundred years of his work -- "In looking for the time of <unk> the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also the ordinary <unk> I mean, everything we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details -- right?
We think about a child trying to get to sleep.
We think about a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard it is.
We forgot how relentless it is.
I mean, this is the books that Virginia <unk> said they were as hard as they were <unk>
I don't know what the word <unk> is, but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It will be very obvious to be very obvious as those principles that are reduced to the person, to desire, their <unk> are a very good narrative base.
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel them, we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel wrong.
By the time storytellers and audience and audience, we know exactly what details would be in order to nail the <unk> right?
The <unk> make us all novelists <unk> and that's something that I understand.
Everything that she does to give me pleasure could give them pleasure -- maybe right now."
And it starts saying that that story, and since then, <unk> says that every charm of cool thing that <unk> senses on his lover -- it adds up to his collection of torture in her private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, the <unk> of <unk> would have to abandon the country, if they wanted to break with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's hard work. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an emotion for you, you have to <unk>
And what are the <unk>
The <unk> get rid of the information.
<unk> use the details.
The <unk> like the big bright hair and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> got rid of the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  <unk> links good language language with jealousy.
When <unk> is on his agony of hell, they suddenly listen to behind the gates and <unk> the <unk> of their lover -- then defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different than the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "These are scientific research with real value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> you see <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they are search for knowledge, for the truth, a really painful truth, in fact, to what they <unk> <unk> the more painful the truth, the better the truth.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> These were the pathways towards the wisdom of <unk>
He says, "A woman who we need to, that makes us suffer, causes us into a range of a much more profound feelings than a wise man who can tell us.
It's telling us that we're going to look for women.
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> reveal ourselves.
And there is some other emotion that makes us <unk> this particular way.
There is some other emotion we would give us our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at intensity so much.
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a very young woman who was being used with the idea that his woman would get it.
And Freud says that there was something strange in that man, which is not <unk> what his wife did.
She was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that he did his wife, without realizing <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> with a man?
Freud says the man was becoming the <unk> of the unconscious, in his wife.
<unk> are very good at this.
<unk> really well how <unk> do they make us look at intensity but without accurately.
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, more we become <unk>
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to do violent acts or illegal.
<unk> they drive us to behave in completely <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about myself -- I think about eight years, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard on the news.
A woman of Michigan for 52 years of age was captured by having created a fake account on Facebook since they would be sent by text messages to themselves, for a year.
It was a year.
She was trying to <unk> the new girlfriend of his former anger, I have to confess that when or this, I reacted to <unk>
Because, let's be realistic.
So what big though is it? If you say, creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a Patricia <unk> novel.
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character from American literature.
This is the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books that try to make our minds our minds -- and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of jealousy, the membrane that separates what might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Let's take his <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or wanting what you have to get out of your self and <unk> from what you ever <unk> and it's under the ground floor, your name, takes your rings, cow bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you all over the world, as much as sometimes I wanted to.
It's a pity, because we live in times of envy.
We live in jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social media, where the coin is <unk> right?
<unk> show us <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not sure, when they are facing a mystery.
Let's go to a Baker Street <unk> and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think about Professor <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always had <unk> <unk> <unk> the head <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> that needs <unk> <unk> needs the genius of <unk> but it does bother it.
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but they <unk> it and <unk> in the each of these puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> once you <unk> <unk> <unk> all with your solution, <unk> goes back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he says there is no person in <unk> <unk> that I didn't want to raise your hand.
It's one of the few times that we see <unk> <unk> in history. I think it seems to me very emotional. That scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat <unk> like a problem of geometry, without emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> is the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute they are on the same side.
Suddenly, <unk> is allowed to admire that idea of being <unk>
I could still be so simple?
What if the <unk> are actually a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow ourselves to be in relation to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to look at the excellence of the other.
We can match it with it.
But I like <unk>
So as we hope that happens, we remember that we have the fiction for <unk>
<unk> fiction -- jealousy.
<unk> alone <unk> invites invited to the table.
And look at what <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Tom <unk> the crazy <unk> the very Marcel Marcel Proust
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July July of July 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped outside the Apollo cover of Apollo 11 and passed over the Sargasso Sea.
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but their presence in the surface of the surface of the surface was the culmination of a collective collective process.
The Apollo program was the most mobilization in the U.S. history.
To get to the Moon NASA spent about 180 billion dollars per day, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo gave about 400,000 people and asked the collaboration of 20,000 businesses, universities and universities and government agencies.
<unk> including the crew of Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo program <unk> 24 men traveled to the moon.
<unk> walked over his surface, of whom escaped the death of Armstrong last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do we <unk>
They didn't have a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 percent later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical response is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to prove to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the words of Kennedy at Rice University in Rice University give us a better idea.
John F. Come on. Some ask, why is it <unk>
Why do it turn it into our goal?
And you could also ask, why can you climb the <unk> mountain.
35 years ago, why would you fly about the <unk>
Why plays Rice versus <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> the Apollo wasn't just a victory of the West about this in the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was <unk> before the powers of the technology.
It was because it was great to be able to do that.
The landing on the moon came in a context of a long list of technological sample.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, it was <unk> the <unk> and eliminated the smallpox.
The technology seemed to have what Alvin <unk> in 1970, called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of mankind, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a horse, or a candle ship, but in 1969, the crew of Apollo 10 miles flew at 40,000 miles an hour.
Since 1970, no human being has gone back to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10, and the joyful optimism about the power of technology has been <unk> to see that the problems that we imagine that the technology would solve as to go to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feeding the world population seem to have a result.
I remember looking at the <unk> of Apollo 17.
I was five years old, and my mother told me that I didn't get to the escape exhaust.
I knew that this would be the last <unk> mission but I was completely sure I was going to see the colonies on Mars.
So that's something like our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We hear it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here, at TED.
It looks like if the technologists would have met us, and they were enriched with trivial toys, things like <unk> app and social media, or algorithms that speed up <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They have expanded and enriched our lives.
But we don't know the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an indicator explanation in Silicon Valley, that <unk> that we have created companies that have created less ambitious than <unk> for the years that <unk> Intel and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are <unk> specifically, the incentives that the venture capitalists offer entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of risk caused the creation of <unk> ideas for funding problems, or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mostly what's wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were at the high point without worrying about the risk, they preferred small investment investment, which they could go out in 10 years.
The <unk> have always had problems to invest with the benefit in technologies as energy, which need a huge capital to develop and whose development is in the long term, we don't have to have ever invested in developing technologies that are intended to solve big problems because they don't have a immediate commercial value.
No, the reasons we can't solve the big problems are most complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we chose to not solve the big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you can <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But to go to Mars would require a political decision that was popular, and that will never happen.
We don't go to Mars because everyone thinks that there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes we can't solve the big problems because political systems fail.
Less than two percent of the world's energy consumption came from solar sources, wind and <unk> less than two percent, and the reason is completely economic <unk>
Carbon and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and the oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want alternative energy sources that can compete at the price.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists are according to what political policies and international treaties are the development of an enhanced energy, <unk> a significant increase in research and development, and some kind of control of the price of coal.
But there is no hope on the political climate that we will see that we will see an energy policy of the U.S. or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes the big problems that seem technological, they are not to be.
We know from time that famines are outcome in the outcome of food.
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are the political crisis that affect the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like crops or systems for the storage of the storage and <unk> but there will be famines while there were bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
The Nixon president was declared the war to cancer in 1971, but soon we found that there are many different kinds of cancer, some terribly resistant to the treatment, and only in the last 10 years, they seem to have effective treatments and viable.
<unk> problems are hard.
It's not true that we can't solve problems with technology.
We can and we can have it, but these four elements have been <unk> political leaders and the population must want to be able to solve the problem; the institutions have to support the <unk> must really be a problem of <unk> and we need to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve great problems, it does have those bill.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There's no <unk> competition like in the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy that <unk> how hard and dangerous, and there is no popular science of science fiction like to explore the solar system.
In general, going to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was only three days.
And really, I didn't even know any problem anymore.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be harder to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start with the <unk> ideas that you have about confidence.
They're so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there has been a great decline of trust, is a very broad issue.
The second is a <unk> we should have more confidence.
And the third is a <unk> we should regain confidence.
I think the goal of the goal and the task has been <unk>
What I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, which I think gives you a very clear idea about the subject.
First of all, why people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the base of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I will prove to me that there may have fallen down in some activities or institutions and that could have raised in others.
I don't have sure.
But I can turn to math surveys and opinion surveys are supposed to be the source of the belief that trust has <unk>
When you look at opinion surveys over time, there's no many evidence of it.
I mean, the people who are <unk> 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, keep <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very safe about 20 years ago, they are still quite <unk> by nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and, by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly halfway on.
But is it enough?
What survey opinion polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can they <unk>
What you see is the <unk> attitudes that people inhabit when they do some questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in <unk>
Now, if someone asked you, "Do you go back to the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in <unk> teachers.
They probably would be asked by asking, "To do what?"
And that would be a very important answer.
And you could say, when you have answered your question, "Well, I trust some of you, but in other no."
Which is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to deposit the confidence.
We don't assume that the confidence that we're going to feel for a very specific type of official or official or type of person, it's going to be uniform in all of those.
I may, for example, say I trust a certain elementary teacher I know to give the type of reading, but in any way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but not maybe, to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we leave all that knowledge when we think about confidence.
I think that surveys are very bad tools to measure the real trust level, because they are trying to embrace the good inherent trial to the fact of trusting something or somebody.
Second, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more confidence.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid goal.
It's not the goal that I <unk>
I want to get more confidence in what is <unk> of trust, but not what it is.
Ultimately, I'm a <unk> of not <unk>
And I think that those people who would take their savings with the very <unk> named Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think of them, and I think, well, yes, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a smart goal in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> intelligence, that's the right goal.
Once you say that, he says, yes, okay, that means that what it matters in the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What it's about to make a judgment on how trustworthy people are in certain ways.
And I think that we can make a trial, we are forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we found that a person is <unk> in the <unk> commodities is responsible and honest, then we will have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be worthy of confidence.
But if, on the contrary, they are not accountable, we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but they didn't get them to carry a letter to the mail -- because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that they can do certain things, but I see that they would take their own <unk>
And I'm happy to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends that are <unk> and responsible for but extremely <unk>
If it's like that, I still haven't been <unk>
But that's what we're looking at -- more than we are <unk>
<unk> is the answer.
The <unk> is what we need to be?
And of course, it's hard.
Over the last decades, we have tried to build accountability for all kinds of institutions, professional people, officials and so forth, that will make us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you'll see the problem is that it takes more time to make the <unk> <unk> than going to be <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public lives, and we need to understand that the accountability system that is meant to guarantee the <unk> and the <unk> testing is actually doing the opposite.
What they do is they <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> as we say.
I'm sure you all know the similar examples.
So let's get all of that, by the goal.
I believe that the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if we need to be worthy of being worthy of trust, and we will give them to the people that are trustworthy and if we are able to figure out whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple actions, the <unk> which doesn't do it properly.
Third, the task.
You would take the task to reconstruct trust, it puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild confidence.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little <unk> trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve confidence.
But trust, ultimately, is a signature because they give us the other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You've got to give them the foundations for them to be able to trust you.
You've got to be worthy of confidence.
And that, of course, is because you can't <unk> by all the people, all the time.
But you also have to be able to deliver <unk> evidence that you're worthy of confidence.
So how do you do it?
That is done every day, everywhere, the common people, the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks says I can <unk> it without giving explanations anymore.
I take them and get me back the money, or they change the color of the color I want.
That's great. I trust them because they become vulnerable to me.
I think there's a great lesson in that.
If you come back vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust, and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So at the end, I think what we're pointing for is not a very difficult thing to <unk>
What people trust is in the relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is worthy of confidence.
Thank you.
Since the beginning of the computers we have been <unk> we have been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and digital information, the separation between our material and the world of the screen in which the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has gone <unk> more and more and more, to perhaps point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of the glass screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to all.
But I ask myself, and if I didn't have <unk>
I started imagining how <unk>
First of all, I created this tool that goes into the digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the transfers transfers their physical body to Vietnam.
Designers can <unk> their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool break the barriers.
But the two hands remain still outside the screen.
How do we get inside and interact with digital information using all the dexterity of your hands?
In the <unk> Science division of Microsoft, along with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little bit of space on the keyboard in a working area of work.
They took a transparent bombsight with a depth of deep cameras to find their fingers and the face, now you can lift the hands of the keyboard, get into the inside space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
Like windows and archives have a location in real space, <unk> is so easy to grab a book from a <unk>
You can flip it through the book and you can highlight lines or words with the virtual touch sensor that there is below every floating screen.
The architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
So in these examples, we are <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make digital information come into us?
And so many of us will be bought and returned things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a <unk> device or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we took this idea further, I thought instead of just seeing pixels in space, how can we make them physicists so we can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to shrink and <unk>
How would a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab, with my tutor trained -- and my collaborator <unk> Post, we created this only physical competition.
This magnet, which is behaving like a 3D pixel in space, which means that the computer as the users can move the object anywhere inside this little three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of levitation and <unk> <unk> mechanical and <unk>
And by programming the object, we release it from the <unk> of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and go back and reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can teach them physically, physically and distance and distance and the famous shot of Michael Jordan, you can reproduce it as a physical reality, sometimes that we want.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the motion of planets, physics, and unlike monitors or textbooks, this is a real experience and palpable experience that you can touch and feel.
But what is most fascinating than changing the physical part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you can see, digital data is not just going to show you something but to start acting directly on us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without having to be aware of our world.
So we started the talk of today talking about a barrier, but if you <unk> that barrier, the only edge is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was embarrassed to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the years.
When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to invite a school for athletes to athletes all expenses <unk>
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Islamic Revolution, they create firmly that there was only a hard way toward <unk> a safe job and <unk>
No matter whether I would like or not.
But my dream was to be an opera from Chinese engineering.
This was me on my imaginary piano.
An opera singer must start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and the host of a radio program.
But no adult asked the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
My friends, my friends, but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew it was too much too much more <unk>
My dream is never <unk>
I would argue that for the rest of my life a second <unk> happiness would be the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
No one to me wanted to <unk> Okay.
Tell the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- I came to the United States in 1995, and what were the first books that I read about here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> it's about life Chinese life.
And it is not propaganda a <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but strange.
That's a subject for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your mother."
<unk> I told me, "Is it so different, and much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to go out of this <unk> guilt trap and to <unk> the relationship with my parents.
And the meeting with a new culture also gave me a place to my surgical read.
You get a lot of perspectives.
For example, this map that I thought was out of place because this is what the students in China learn.
I would never have happened, that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
<unk> read is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are to research fields like comparative religion and comparative literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers the academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if the comparative reading was worked for research, why don't we do it in the <unk> life.
So I started reading books from two.
They can be <unk> <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who were involved in a same <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
To <unk> the <unk> are economic and spiritual and spiritual lives.
To Buddha, they're all <unk> lust, fear and <unk> <unk>
If you know another language, it's also fun to read their favorite books in two languages.
<unk> path of <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Alan <unk> Instead of losing in the translation, I found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
The books opened me a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to be feeling like I used or powerless before.
Having a dream <unk> is really nothing compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that I'm not the only purpose of a dream.
Her most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams, of where the passion comes from, where happiness.
Until a <unk> dream can do that for you.
And it's thanks to the books, that today I'm here, happy, living again with clarity, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my 20s, I saw my first customer <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology in Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman called <unk>
And Alex went into the first session using jeans and a Japanese photographer and threw on the couch in my office <unk> <unk> the shoes and told me he wanted to talk about their problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My lecture partner, he had a <unk> as a first client.
And I had a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought to the <unk> became easy for me to just move the head while I was able to make the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> said, Alex, and what I looked like, she was right.
You start working later, you start working later, you have children later, to death later.
And it was like Alex and I had time to go.
But shortly later, my <unk> <unk> was to press Alex who would talk about his life <unk>
I was hooked.
I said, "Yes, he's coming out with guys under his category, <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not like it was to marry it."
And then my <unk> he said, "It's still not, but maybe you get to the next.
In addition, the best time to work in the marriage of Alex is before it <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk>
It was when I realized that the <unk> aren't the new <unk>
Yes, people sit in the head after what they had, but this didn't make sure the <unk> of Alex was a pause in their development.
This made the <unk> of Alex was the perfect moment and we were <unk>
And so I realized, that this kind of recklessness <unk> was a real problem and had real consequences, not only for Alex and his loving life, but for the careers the families and the future of them all over the place.
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think that nobody comes to age without going on before the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, Yes! It's amazing.
If you work with <unk> love a <unk> you take your dream -- a <unk> I want to see. It's okay. They really matter.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will spend 35 years old.
This means that eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and moments of moments that they give their life may have been in order to have 30 and <unk>
People of the more 40, we don't <unk>
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career has an exponential impact on the amount of money that we <unk>
We know that more than half the Americans are married, they live with their future partner to the 30 years.
And we know that the brain ends up their second and last stage of growth in their <unk> and they <unk> for the <unk> which means that if there's something they want to change themselves, now it's time to change it.
We know that the personality takes more times during their <unk> than at any other moment of life, and we know that the female fertility reaches its top at 28, and things become complicated to the <unk>
The <unk> are the moment for <unk> on their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five are crucial to language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment when your daily life and common life has an impact on the person who <unk>
But what we don't hear is often that there is something called adult development and our <unk> are an critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the time line of <unk>
The researchers call the <unk> a extended adolescence of an extended adolescence.
<unk> <unk> names of the <unk> like <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines <unk>
<unk> <unk> said that to achieve big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not it?
What do you think when you give a <unk> on your head, and you say, you have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and it doesn't happen absolutely nothing.
And then every single day, and they were really interesting and interesting and their children and daughters come to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend, is not good for me, but this relationship is not really not yet. I'm just killing time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that while I start a career before 30, everything is okay."
But then it starts to sound something like this: "My <unk> are <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
He had better partner the day I <unk>
And then it starts to sound like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the chairs.
They all were running and <unk> but then somewhere around 30, turned out the music and all started to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only person who would be standing, so sometimes I think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds kind of <unk> but it's not <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there's a huge pressure for the 30 and so many of you to start a career, to choose a city, choosing a partner, and have two or three children in a very short period of time.
And so many of these things are not <unk> and there are research that start to show, which is much more difficult and stressful <unk> to do everything from the <unk>
The middle-aged crisis is not about buying red sports cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want now.
You realize you can't have the child you want now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and I sitting in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was they doing? What was you thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here is a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
By 25, Emma came to my office because he was, in his own words, having an identity.
He said that he would like to work in art or in entertainment, but they still couldn't decide, so it spent the last few years working as <unk>
As it was cheaper, I was living with a boyfriend, the more <unk> that ambition.
And despite living some very difficult <unk> his previous life had been even more difficult.
It turns out often in our <unk> but then she <unk> itself as she said, "You don't pick your family, but you can pick your friends."
Well, one day Emma got his head on his legs and he cried for almost every time.
I had just bought a new book book to <unk> and it had gone all the way to her a lot of <unk> but then I was looking at the empty space that follows after the words "In emergency case, please call <unk>
I was about the <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of if he gives me <unk>
At that time, it took me a lot of work to resist and I didn't say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that they really did.
Emma needed a better life, and I knew that this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit while the 1950s.
So for the next few weeks and months, I said to Emma three things that all <unk> man, or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I told Emma that they took care of that identity crisis and <unk> identity capital.
For identity, I mean to do something that add value to your person.
Doing something that's an investment in what you want to be after.
I didn't know the future of the career, and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this: identity capital generates identity.
So now it's time for that work on the other side of the country, from that company that you want to try to try it.
I'm not <unk> the exploration, I am <unk> the exploration that I shouldn't count, which, by the way, it's not exploration, by the way.
It's <unk>
I told him to explore jobs and make them count.
Second, I said to Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you to the airport, but the <unk> who come together with friends with minds like who you know what you know, what you think about how you talk, and where you work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who will come out almost always come from the outside of the nearest circle.
The new things come from what they're called weak bonds from their friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job or don't have work.
But the other half won't, and the weak bonds are the form of <unk> to this group.
The half of the jobs we ever created is never <unk> then knowing the head of your neighbor is the way to get a job not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is happening.
For the last but not least, Emma believed that you don't pick his family, but I know their friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but like <unk> Emma soon would give her family when they have a partner and we form their own family.
I told Emma that time to choose their family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better age to sit on your mind than 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But choosing the person that you live now, or let you go now when all on Facebook, you start walking into the <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and that means being as <unk> in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what you want instead of just making it work or killing time with anyone who's going to get them to you.
So what happened with <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found a fellow of the room of a cousin who worked in an art museum in another state.
This weak link helped me get a job there.
That labor supply gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend, that they live.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special events in museums.
This married a man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, he loves his new family, and I sent me a letter that said, "Now the spaces of emergency workers are not <unk> enough.
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help you.
The <unk> are like planes coming out from Los Angeles, to go out somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a light fits in its trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or in <unk>
In the same way, at 21 or the 25th and even the <unk> a good conversation, a good TED Talk can have huge effects over the years or even in the next generations.
Here's my idea worth spreading all the <unk> that you know.
It's as simple as what I learned to say to <unk>
This is what I now have the privilege of telling me as Emma every day: <unk> is not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get their identity, get their identity, use their weak bonds pick up your family.
They don't define by what they didn't know or what they didn't did.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very tough job in management management for a job that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I was to teach them mathematics to <unk> in the public schools in New York City.
And as any teacher, I made tests and testing.
Let me give you tasks.
When I work back, I went down grades.
What struck me the attention was that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of the people who had a better performance didn't have scores <unk>
Some of my smartest kids were not going so well.
And that set me thinking.
The kind of thing that you need to learn in math in seventh grade, safely -- are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that each of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and for enough time.
And after several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure it better.
It's the <unk> but what if you're successful in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn how fast and easy?
So I left the classroom and I went to college to become <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all kinds of <unk> scenarios and every study my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We tried to predict what <unk> <unk> in military training and who are <unk>
We went to the National <unk> of <unk> and we tried to predict what children are going to do as far as possible.
We studied early teachers, working in really difficult neighborhoods, what teachers are still teaching for the end of the school year and <unk> who will be the most effective in improving the results of the learning of their <unk>
We teamed up with private enterprises, which of these vendors are going to keep their <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all those very different contexts, arose a trait like a major success of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physical health, it wasn't <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and perseverance to achieve very long-term goals.
<unk> is having a resistance.
<unk> is clinging to its future, day after day, not only for the week, not only for the month, but for years, and working really hard to make that future reality.
The determination is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a <unk>
A few years ago, I started studying the determination of Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students to make my questionnaires of determination and then waited for more than a year to see those who are <unk>
It turns out that the most determination with more determination had significantly higher odds even when the <unk> in every feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of <unk> tests, even the safety they felt when they were at school.
So it's not only in West Point or in the National <unk> <unk> where <unk> is also in school, especially for children at risk.
To me, the most shocking thing about determination is the little thing that we know about the science of the development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do you have the determination in children?
What should I do to teach children to a robust <unk>
How do we keep them for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent is not <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals who just don't keep ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, climate determination is not related or is even related to the talent measures talent.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing the determination of children is something called <unk>
This is an idea that at Stanford University, for Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not <unk> that it can change the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grow in response to the challenge, they are much more likely to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't believe that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth mindset is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have on the front.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need <unk>
We need to measure if they have been successful and we need to be willing to fail, to help them start everything again with the lessons <unk>
In other words, we need to be certain about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan like the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories.
Since that time, I was struck by this incredible language.
But for a foreigner. It seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall of China.
Over the last few years, I've been asking myself if I can break this <unk> so anyone who is to want to understand and appreciating the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new and quick approach to learn Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the strokes of each character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Because we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
An Chinese academic author <unk> 20 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic <unk>
The first 200 of them will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough to read <unk> traffic signals, to understand the basic idea of web pages or the paper.
Today I'll start with eight to show you how the method.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as you could even be <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to take a ride.
<unk>
If the shape of fire is a person with arms in both sides, like if I was shouting, <unk> <unk> I am <unk> This is a symbol that is actually <unk> the shape of the flame but I like to believe it is the other way.
This is a tree.
tree tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of gates on the old West <unk>
I call <unk> to these eight characters.
They're building blocks so that they create a lot more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are a company, three are crowd.
If a person stretches their arms, this person is saying <unk> <unk>
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a dilemma as <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the <unk>
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk> --  <unk> to remember, as a typical tree is pretty idiot.
Do you remember the fire?
Two together, it's very hot.
Three together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
A door. You put a table inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, ask questions.
<unk> played on someone at home?
This person is going out hidden from one door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, they're <unk>
So we've had almost 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radical -- will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build other 32.
So with every little effort, you will be able to learn a couple of hundreds of characters, which is the same thing that you learn for a eight years.
So after knowing the characters, we started creating sentences.
For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the land of the sun.
This is a sun placed with the beginning, because Japan is in China.
So a sun next we started, we create Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left is two mountains stacked up on the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, <unk> has become out.
A mouth that tells you to go out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I have to stop talking and down the stage. Thank you.
What I want to be my dad is the movies I get to see.
I love to share my favorite movies with my <unk> when my daughter was four, we saw the magician of Oz together.
The film took their imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and bring a magic wand and they put a magic wand and they put a magic wand and they put a magic wand and they put a magic wand and they put a magic wand and they put a magic wand and they put a magic wand and they put a magic wand and they put a magic wand
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and we raise our children into a kind of industrial complex.
However, the magician of Oz was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took spent 40 years later with, except, interestingly, another movie whose <unk> a metal guy and a <unk> <unk> a girl on her head <unk>
You know what I'm talking about?
There's a big difference between these two movies, there are a couple of big differences between the magician of Oz and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there are very little violence in the magician of <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think that if the magician of Oz will do today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz like the prophecy.
<unk> magical shoes to defeat the armies were made by the <unk> computer.
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing about the magician of Oz is that the <unk> characters and even <unk> are women.
I started to notice this when I made "Star <unk> to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, he had a son.
Only three years old.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the <unk> of surveillance had been <unk>  And so she was able to be in the room and was impressed as a mom with her <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was going on, but -- but <unk> it all.
I wonder what to do?"
Would you be important value, attitude and <unk>
So I would have the feeling that Luke get one to an army to <unk> the government?
<unk> this with the magician of Oz of <unk>
How does it be Dorothy his movie?
They do a good deal with each and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up, and you don't have a world of men that <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there so much of the capital of crime F, force in movies for our children, and so little on the way of building <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know in the experience that Princess <unk> it doesn't give me the proper framework that would have served me to navigate the world of adults who is <unk>  I think at the moment of the first sentence, I really expected the credit to come up because it's the end of the film, right?
My search is finished, I have a <unk>
Why are they standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies focused on defeat the <unk> and getting their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be a dumb animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are a lot of exceptions, and there are a lot of exceptions, and to stand up to the Disney <unk> to any of you.
But they send a message to the children, even though they, guys, they're not really their goal.
They do a phenomenal job when they teach girls how to defend the <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend them from the <unk>
There is no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, so real and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies from war.
Of course, the most successful issue of all times is still appearing in classic and classic each of them on the <unk> of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who raised a child.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, finally came out.
I recommend all of you. It's already available in stores.
Remember what the criticism was when he came out of <unk>
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a <unk>
It's really good. You don't let me know that.
Well, almost none of these movies happens the test of <unk>
I don't know if you heard about this.
It's still not rooted in the roots and already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book book -- and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation that had had a friend of mine on the <unk> of movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that must be <unk> in the film, there is more than a female character that has lines?
So you have to get the <unk>
These women talk about each other in the movie?
Their conversations are about something else from the kid that you like it?  Right? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women that exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen it, and yet very rarely I see it in the cinema that we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good quality, <unk>
Right? <unk> <unk> success -- an idea of consensus from what is a Hollywood Hollywood film.
<unk> doesn't happen the test of <unk>
And I don't think that I think -- because a lot of the film, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the film happens in a embassy where men and women are hiding during the <unk> crisis.
We have lots of scenes from men who have deep and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great moment for one of the <unk> to take a look at the door and say, "Get the bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's go through the numbers.
In 2011, of the 100 more popular movies, how many of them believe they have actors who have <unk>
<unk> It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage as the number of women that we've chosen recently for Congress, then it's okay.
But there is a bigger number than this is going to take up this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he said, this is what he was.
In the United States, one in five women says it has been sexually assaulted in their life.
I don't think it's the guilt of mass entertainment.
I don't think the movies for children have something to do with that.
I also don't believe that music videos or pornography are closely <unk> but something is wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things I think there is a lot of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are you <unk>
What do they not get <unk>
They're <unk> the story that says the role of a male hero is to <unk> with violence and then collect the reward, which is a woman who doesn't have friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this very compelling statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools to our available like <unk> <unk> and we hope that that <unk> but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean primarily the parents.
I think we have to show our male children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of manhood is radically changing.
You've read about how the new economy is changing the role that I care about from the home and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what his favorite favorite character was his favorite page of "Star <unk> Do you know what you want.
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What does this two?
Maybe it's not just the bright dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help them reach their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want to be less stories in which I tell my <unk> Go and struggle only and more stories where his work looks like to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people to improve and be better people, like the magician magician <unk>
Thank you.
As a little girl, I lived in Maine and one of the things that I had most liked was looking for sea biscuits on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that I would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered with sand, and it's hard to see them.
And yet, with time, I would give me to <unk>
I started to see shapes and patterns that helped me to <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love of the past and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized to see with my own eyes not enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up at one of 1.3 miles away from the <unk>
It had grown up the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite imagery.
To try and make a map of the past, I knew I had to see it differently.
So I want to show you an example of how different we see when you use the <unk>
This is a place located in the eastern Delta.
And the place, simple sight, seems to be brown, but when we use the infrared and we process it using fake color, suddenly the place looks like pink rose to it.
What you're seeing is the actual chemical changes of the landscape caused by the construction materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how the satellite data to find an ancient <unk> city, called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital of the old Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the Empire the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place lies in the <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle East, there was this great renaissance of the ancient <unk> art and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> inside the red circles, but somewhere inside this enormous <unk> <unk>
This area is huge measures about <unk> per mile away.
We threw up the Nile <unk> right next to the <unk> and as it changed over time, it moved down to this and just <unk> the city.
So how do you find a city <unk> in a <unk> landscape.
I'll try to find that randomly would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with the eyes and using baseball.
So, we use NASA data from NASA to make a map of place, with very subtle changes.
So we were able to see where they are, <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this slightly big area that you see inside the circle here, which we think could be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with Egyptians doing <unk> jobs -- you can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like the shots of showing in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human <unk>
Five meters down, underneath a thick thick layer of mud, we find a dense layer of <unk>
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five meters down, we have a <unk> <unk> of several hundred years that date out of the Empire exactly the same period that we believe is <unk>
We also found <unk> <unk> <unk> quartz and <unk> which shows that there was a <unk> shop.
This might seem like it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common rocks used in the harbor jewelry, these are the stones that are <unk>
So, we have a dense layer of <unk> which goes back in this place.
We also have evidence of an elite defense shop, which shows that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find <unk> here, but let's get to the place in a near future for <unk>
And more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also make great discoveries.
I want to finish with my favorite quote from the Middle East, probably it was written in <unk> 4,000 years ago.
I'm going to share knowledge is the most of all the <unk>
There's nothing like that on land.
So apparently TED was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
So the ideas really started in 1984 BC.
It certainly puts the <unk> search in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside the door to <unk>
I'd like to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that's made.
Now we got a group of <unk> <unk> in cars.
They are competing in a racing race and they go in the direction of their entry door.
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk>
They collide against the door of their house.
There are bikes flying around everywhere, the wheels that go on the side of the wheels that end up in <unk> places -- the threshold of the gate, <unk>
And to the lobby, the hall, or what is on the other side of the door, and notice the quality of the light. The light is shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
He's waving with the hand.
It's from his chair on a brown horse.
It's a horse to talk about.
You can feel your blue <unk> making it tickle your nose.
You can smell the <unk> <unk> and you can go to the point of getting into your mouth.
They went on one side and enter their living room.
In the room, and making the maximum use of their imagination, just imagine Britney <unk>
He's with little clothes, dancing on his center, singing <unk> I was <unk> One More <unk>
Now let the kitchen.
The ground has been coated with a yellow building path and from the oven coming into you -- the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of the hands, jumping towards you.
You open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a particular particular competition that has done every spring in New York City.
It's called the <unk> <unk>
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a <unk> journalist, I guess, I guess, that this was like the end of a <unk>
There were several men and a few ladies and a few different ages and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of <unk> numbers look at them once.
<unk> the names of tens and dozens of strangers.
We had entire poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who could memorize the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was thinking, "This is <unk>
These people have to be about nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This one is a man named Ed Cook who had come from England and has one of the best <unk> memories.
I asked her, <unk> when you realized you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I'm not a wise.
Actually, I have an average memory.
Everybody who involved in this competition say they have normal memory.
And we said, "We have been trained to perform these miracle acts of memory using some old techniques -- invented a half years ago in Greece, the same techniques that used <unk> to memorize their narratives -- and that <unk> academics used to memorize books for <unk>
And my reaction was, <unk> How did I have heard of this <unk>
We were standing outside the hall of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant English guy, although a little bit <unk> said, <unk> you are an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What?" No, why?
Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize order on a deck of <unk> live on national television.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
So you have to start for something <unk>
And that was the beginning of a very strange trip to me.
And I ended up spending most of the next year not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what their potential.
I met a lot of interesting people.
This is a man called <unk>
He is <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that I had a <unk> problem is awesome.
Somebody incredibly tragic, but it was a window to allow us to see what extent our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum, I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> who was based on the <unk> <unk> movie in the movie <unk>
We went through one afternoon in the public library in Salt Lake City, <unk> guides <unk>
And when we came back, it was a number of treaties on the written memory of the memory written something over 2,000 years ago in Latin, the <unk> and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having disciplined and disciplined <unk> wasn't a thing as rare as it might seem like today.
A very long time, people invest in their memory, to provide their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but they also have changed.
We have changed <unk> and I would argue that they have changed us as well.
As we have almost no need to remember, sometimes we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people who are passionate about this idea of a disciplined and disciplined memory is this very unique competition of memory.
It's actually not that <unk> there is <unk> like this around the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
So a few years ago, a group of researchers from University College invited to a memory set of memory, in the lab.
They wanted to know: Is it going to be a brains in some structural way, or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
They're more intelligent than <unk>
They gave them a cognitive test, and the answer was actually no.
I had yet a really interesting difference and meaningful between the brains of memory champions and the subjects of control with the <unk>
When they put them in an MRI MRI machine, they would take their brains as long as they <unk> numbers and forms of snow <unk> they found that in memory champions were <unk> parts of the brain, different than others.
They actually <unk> or seemed <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial and navigation.
Why? There is something we can learn from this?
The tournament for <unk> competitive is driving as a armed career where every year you see someone with a new way of remembering more things, more quickly, and then the rest of the competitors must get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a memory.
In his desk, in front of him, there are 36 <unk> of <unk> <unk> which he's about to try and memorize an hour, using a technique that he invented and just he <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits <unk>
It Yes.
And while there's a huge amount of ways of remembering things in these competitions, absolutely all the techniques used by the end of the end of a single concept that psychologists call <unk>
It is illustrates with a elegant paradox known as the paradox <unk> <unk> says the following: I mean two people who remember the same word -- I say to you, you know, there's a man called <unk>
That's their <unk>
And then I ask you, "You know, there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I asked them to tell you that word I told you a <unk>
So what would you say?
The person who said that his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who said his job is <unk>
The same word, different capacity of <unk> that's weird.
What about here?
Well, the name is really nothing for you. It has no relationship to you.
With all the other memories that dance on your head.
But the word <unk> We know <unk>
They wear white <unk>
They have <unk>
It was okay when they come home to work.
Would you probably have some <unk>
And when you get that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some after that.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this over a half thousand years ago in Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story says this: There was a poet called <unk> which I attended a <unk>
They had hired him as entertainment, because before, if he wanted to give a very good party, they didn't bring a little bit of a <unk> to a <unk>
He stood up standing up with his memory poem, and he went down, and so soon it was, the classroom.
Let's get all of us.
But not only killed everyone, but it shattered the bodies by <unk> <unk>
No one could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting there.
So you couldn't get the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
<unk> out outside, only survivor, in the midst of the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with his minds in his mind, I could see where I had been sitting every single suit.
It took the family of the <unk> hand, where their loved ones were on the rubble.
What they <unk> <unk> at that moment is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it is that no matter if we are not good to remember names or phone numbers or instructions for the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and space <unk>
If you ask them to give me the first 10 words in the history that I just told you about <unk> is very likely to find them very hard to do it.
But I would bet that if you asked them to tell them who was sitting on the brown iPod in their <unk> they would be able to <unk>
The idea of the palace of memory is to create this building with the eyes of your mind, and the <unk> the <unk> the more crazy -- the more crazy -- <unk> <unk> and <unk> is the image, more <unk>
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first memory treaties in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say you guys have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and want to do it from memory, in the same way that they would have done it -- if they were invited to <unk> it was 2,000 years ago.
What you could do is you can imagine you're at the door of your house.
And to come up with some sort of an absolutely ridiculous image of and <unk> to help you remember that the first thing that you want to mention is that utterly <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine entering your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And that would remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to count.
And then they entered the kitchen, and the fourth thing they would talk about would be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help them remember it.
This is how speakers <unk> <unk> their speeches -- not word by word, going to confuse them but typical by typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a breath of when people thought about <unk> and in the rhetoric with this sort of space terms.
The phrase <unk> <unk> would be the first place in their memory.
I saw that this was just fascinating, and I got stuck with that.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing something long about this <unk> of <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a <unk> event.
And really, it's like looking at a lot of people sitting on exams. I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when somebody gets <unk>
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in these people, but I don't have access to me.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sit down to see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an ancient <unk> <unk> <unk> market.
And I discovered that this was fun.
I would never have expected you to get it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training the memory.
What it's actually about to do is do better and more the ability to create and imagine these images that are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was really pretty close to this.
This is me, using my standard training team for memory.
It's a couple of <unk> and some of the security bars with tape leaving only two <unk> because the distraction.
And I ended up coming back to the same contest that I had been covering a year before, and I had the idea that I could put it in a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could serve for good <unk> for all my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something I didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's nice to be able to memorize <unk> and telephone numbers, but actually this is not the point.
These are just <unk> tricks.
Because they are based on quite basic principles about how the brain works.
And it is not necessary to be able to put off the memory of the memory or to memorize <unk> to benefit with a little bit of insights about how your mind.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a <unk> <unk> but it's not the case.
Big memories are <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus deeply.
The palace of <unk> These memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us care?
It would be sort of a deep processing species, a kind of <unk> care that most of you are not going to go down there.
But the reality is that there are no shortcuts.
This is how things do <unk>
And if there's something that I want to leave you with today, is what I think -- the <unk> that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, let me say that it's the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is our <unk> existence in the <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walks into our side, we will be so <unk> that we don't even bother to process <unk>
I learned firsthand that there are incredible memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a living, you must be the guy who remembers remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex issue, so it would be just a <unk> place in New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm from <unk> Jersey, I was six years old, and I lived there at a village called <unk> and this was my <unk>
In the corner, since my bedroom, I was the bathroom I shared with my sister.
And in between my bedroom and the toilet, there was an balcony that was giving the living room.
And there everyone passed the television back; so every time I went from my room to the bathroom, everyone looked at me, and every time I got it up, and I would come back in a towel -- all I see me.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> not safe and hated it.
I hated that journey, I hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
All right.
Those feelings that I felt, that is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about math, because architecture is not about mathematics, or division of areas that are emotional <unk> that we feel in the places that we think.
And it's not surprising that we feel that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency spend 90 percent of their time under the roof.
So 90 percent of the time we are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
The architecture determines us in ways that we don't even notice it.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you care about, you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know that you think about it for based on a building built two thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a <unk>
It's a <unk> that uses the architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an emotional connection -- we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We used it 200 years ago to build banks.
We used it in the 19th century to build art.
And in the 20th century, we used it to build homes.
See, these <unk> stable, stable, <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, and it's very complicated.
The people that <unk> the <unk> and governments are always afraid to innovation, and they prefer to use ways they know that they're going to work.
So we found buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public Public Public Library that ended up in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, it has a <unk> it has this kind of thing, and it has this thing -- and it has this kind of thing, and what you can do is to communicate with this <unk> the children, the values values -- history.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year in 2004, the other side of the country, ended up another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new type of equipment for the city, a place to meet together, read and share.
So how it's possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both so-called libraries, be so different?
And the answer is that architecture works according to the beginning of <unk>
On one side is the <unk> the architects that constantly drive new technologies, new technologies, new new technologies, new solutions for life forms today.
We would sort of push it and we got it so much, we get away from the people.
All of the black, this is <unk> you think that we think we feel very well, but we're dead because we have no other option.
We need to go to the other side and go back to those symbols.
So we do that, and we are all happy, but we feel like <unk> so we started to experience <unk> we can swing the pendulum back forward, over and over again, so we've done it in the last 300 years, and of course, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago was about the 1970s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
You can guess.
<unk> small <unk> on scale.
Really really hard.
So we get to the '80s, and we started to bring those symbols.
<unk> the next one in the other direction.
We take those ways we know that like and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we added bake and we use new materials.
They love it.
We don't give <unk>
We took <unk> and we turned it into skyscrapers that can be <unk> <unk> made of glass.
The shapes became <unk> won on boldness and <unk>
The <unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
A madness.
But it was the '80s, that was great.
We all spent the time in business centers, we moved to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we could create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be <unk> to the French or the Italian trial.
You may have a shock of bread.
This is what happens with <unk>
This is what happens with symbols.
They're easy, because instead of creating new spaces, we create memories of other places.
I know very well, and you all know this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects feel frustrated and we started to make a swing on the other direction.
In the 1980s and early '90s, we started to experiment with the so-called <unk>
We have the <unk> symbols now we have new design techniques -- which is a computer -- and we found ourselves with new <unk> a few ways that they were attached to other forms.
This is an academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> One is totally <unk>
Normally, the pendulum <unk> in the opposite direction.
But then something happened to be a <unk>
In 1997, this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when critics and public and public and public in general, were completely known about a building.
The New York Times <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> in Bilbao grew up in a 2,500 percent when they ended up the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first one star.
But how is it possible that these wild and wild ways, how can we be able to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media <unk> around them and quickly learned that those shapes meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
The main mayors in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon of the back of the new millennium country happened with other star architects.
I went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects in the new millennium, actually started moving with all the architecture, digital media started to increase the speed of information consumption up.
Think for example, how do you consume architecture.
A thousand years ago, they would have to have walked to the next town to see a building.
The transportation is <unk> they can take a boat, a plane, they can be <unk>
<unk> technology. You can see in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, all of us are photographers of architecture, and the building is beyond their physical location.
The architecture is everywhere, it means that the speed of communications has reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is moving so fast.
It's not really accurate for thinking about a building.
You need a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 more buildings, before we know if the one that I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
That's how we find buildings like this.
The <unk> wasn't a <unk> movement, but 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we didn't have any idea how much the <unk>
That is never going to happen to happen. Because we are in the threshold of the largest revolution in architecture since the invention of the <unk> of steel or <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when you apply the media to media, it starts to swing faster and faster, until you get into both extremes -- almost in <unk> and you have effectively the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and you know, the audience.
We can now make symbols almost <unk> with emotional burden of something completely new.
I'll show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We went <unk> to replace this building that was <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in the state of New York City.
It's a <unk> community.
But that meant two years before the building, was already finished the building, it was already part of the community, and like the drawings looked exactly the product, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community, that first summer, when people started to get and share it in social media, the building stopped being a building, turned into a media, because these are not just images of a building, is the images that one made of the building.
And as you use them to tell their story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes it <unk> with collective memory, and by bringing these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks tell us how to think of architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians in <unk>
If that building was built today, first of course <unk> the Internet in search of <unk> <unk>
They were bombarded with examples of <unk> innovation, about what a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> who can lead the mayor of <unk> people from <unk> and tell them that there is no unique response to what a library is today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experiment.
It's all different now.
The architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use words and drawings and complicated, and one is no longer an Indian audience, which doesn't accept something that hasn't seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't leave it for architecture.
That means that the pendulum <unk> of one style to another, from one movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find <unk> solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in tomorrow will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that an public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be only <unk> and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad imitation of a red brick of red brick with the ideas of what a stadium should be.
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for the ways that are going to produce.
That means that the buildings <unk> the <unk> of nature and not the reverse.
This means that a parking garage in Miami Beach, Florida, also it can serve for sports or <unk> or even you can stand there at night.
This means that three architects can dream at the East <unk> of New York, and raise half a million dollars of the community together around that cause, it's no customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little <unk> <unk> and <unk> as the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what we build.
The architects already know how to make buildings more <unk> more intelligent and more kind.
We've been waiting for all of you to love them.
Finally, we're not on the opposite side.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there is a lot in play.
Buildings not only reflect our society, but they give it way to the most <unk> spaces -- local libraries -- the homes where we form our kids, and the <unk>
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and he started walking.
And it does this very cool way of the kids in a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things you like to do for the moment is <unk> in the mirror.
She really loves his reflection.
It <unk> and <unk> and it gives itself those kisses big and <unk>
It's beautiful.
So apparently, all his friends do this, and my mom tells me that I used to do it, and I was thinking, "When did I stop doing this?
How is it that we really are not comfortable with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking at Google: "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old and lives in <unk>
And as any teenager just wants to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for the next week in school.
It's a bit of fear, it's a little bit confused because, although your mom says all the time it's beautiful, every day in school, somebody says it's ugly.
Among what his mom says and what his friends, or partners in the school says, "You don't know who to believe.
So a video of her itself, publishes it on YouTube, and he calls others who please leave a <unk> "I'm a nice or I'm <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has gotten more than 13,000 comment.
Some of these are so <unk> that they don't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a normal and normal teenager, which gets these answers in one of the most vulnerable life of their life more vulnerable life.
Thousands of people are posting like this, in most of these teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it going to do this?
Well, the teenagers of today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, and that all the time, talking about -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
We never have been so connected to a continuous way, so young.
As a mother said, "It's like there's a party in his room all the <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures that goes from the hand with that are <unk>
This environment, to be always connected, is attached to our children to <unk> based on the number of likes that they have and the comments that they get.
There is no division between a online life and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what is real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what is authentic and what is its digitally.
What is the greatest thing in the life of someone in front of what it is normal in a day?
And where are you looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> of the news from the girls now.
<unk> <unk> continue to dominate our <unk>
The <unk> technique is now a routine.
And <unk> like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in the popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what the young.
But the kids aren't immune to this.
Like the <unk> of the sport, and the singers <unk>
But what is the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our kids to grow healthy and be <unk> individuals.
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we are teaching our children to spend more time and effort to look at the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical skills, their studies and other aspects begin to suffer.
Six hundred girls would rather be doing something because they think they don't see nice enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They are fundamental activities for their growth as human beings and how <unk> society and the business of labor development.
31 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the class in class.
One in five are not attending class at all the days when you don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the season of tests, if you don't think you see it good enough if you don't believe you're good enough -- I think a lower note to the average of your fellow who don't care about that appearance.
And this phenomenon has widespread in Finland, the United States and China.
And there's regardless of what these young people actually weigh these young people.
So to be well of course, we're talking about how you see you, not what you're really like.
The low self-worth on your body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk>
<unk> with time they do less physical activity, they eat less fruits and vegetables, they participate in more diet that they don't get to take them into a food disorder, and they can take them into a food disorder.
They have low self-esteem.
They are more easily <unk> by the people around them and are at greatest risk of depression.
And we thought it's all about all of this because of what they make more thoughtful decisions like the consumption of alcohol and drugs, diet <unk> aesthetic <unk> sexual relationships and no protection and protection and damage.
The search for the perfect body is pushing the healthcare system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they have overweight again, regardless of whether or they have not higher rates of <unk>
On 17 percent of women are not presented with a job interview on a day that they don't feel secure with the way they see.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we were able to overcome this, what would that attempt would be.
We have this potential for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, for itself, you don't get too far.
Not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key forms. The first is that we have to instill in their own body.
We need to help our teenagers to develop strategies to overcome the pressure of the perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very struck by when I learned that many good programs, I didn't know what the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that follows our children will not only have a positive impact, but also a lasting impact.
And research studies show that the best programs are focused on six key areas, the first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are starting points of crucial now for anyone to provide education in your body self-esteem than work.
An education is a <unk> but dealing with this problem for each of us to take the progress on the issue and be a better model to keep the women and girls in our own lives.
We challenge the status of the current status of how women are seen and mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to tell you with the input of our politicians in <unk> or the size of their <unk> or <unk> that the determination or the success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start judging the people by what they are, not because they see it.
We can all start doing it by taking responsibility for the type of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can push people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you -- When was the last time you put a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and as businesses, to really change our culture, so that our children grow up to be valuing their entire person, valuing individuality, diversity, <unk>
We need to put the people who are really making the difference in a <unk>
And let's make a difference in the real world, let's make it the ones that come out on the big screen, because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe that they are never <unk> of being the ones who are, or to reach what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean to someone in your lives.
Who do you have in your mind?
His <unk>
His <unk>
His <unk>
His <unk> A <unk>
It could be just the woman who's on two seats. What would it mean for her if he was released from that voice and he was released in his interior, he would stop him for not to have a long legs. They would get more <unk> a faster belly -- <unk> <unk>
What would it mean for her if we were doing this, and we would recognize their potential in that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with images is attached to us.
But let's get our kids the truth.
You know, the way you see that the way you see is just a part of your identity, and the truth is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and because they make us feel.
We put the self-worth in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each one of us, the way we talk about and compared to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year of age today, they become <unk> agents in <unk>
So let's do it.
The five of November 1990, a guy named <unk> <unk> entered a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the League of Defense <unk>
It was initially what they were like, but they were a prisoner of other minor charges in the company, in the company of others, started planning attacks on about 12 images of New York, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
So luckily, those plans were <unk> by an FBI from the FBI.
Sadly, the bomb of 1993 in the World Trade Center couldn't be done.
Later on, she would be convicted of their participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being a <unk> engineer, with a loving mother, a <unk> teacher at the two made everything possible for giving me happy.
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of Islam that very few, including most Muslims come to meet.
For experience I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't need a lot to get the same things in life.
However, in all religion, in every human group, there is always a tiny fraction of people who were so attached to their convictions that thinks that we need to use all the possible means that everyone lived as them.
A few months before he arrest him sat with me and explained that in the last weekends of week, he told me that in the last weekends of week, he and some friends, had been going into training on Long Island to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We came to the <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I touched my father -- my father helped me hold the <unk> on the shoulder and explained to me how to aim for about 30 meters.
That day, with the last bullet I shot -- I gave the little orange light on the goal and, to surprise me, especially mine, all the goal broke on fire.
My uncle went back to the others, and in Arabic, he said <unk> <unk>
He said, "How did you son.
All of all, the comment produced a lot of laughter. But just a few years later, I understood what they thought to them as funny.
You see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be <unk> to put up with 700 pounds of explosives in the North Trade Center in the North Trade Center -- causing a explosion that killed six people and hurt other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved to 20 times. That instability during my childhood was not allowed to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable about someone was now <unk> and going to another city.
As I was always the new way of the class, I was often a <unk>
<unk> secret <unk> my identity to avoid being the whites -- but to be the new of the class silent and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I was going on at home reading books, watching television or playing video games.
For these reasons I didn't develop social skills, to say <unk> <unk> <unk> wasn't prepared for the real world.
I was inspired by opera to judge people, based on indicators and race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put together my way to think, was during the presidential elections, in 2000.
In a <unk> program, where I was involved in the National Convention in the National Convention in Philadelphia.
My group was focused on the subject of juvenile violence as I had been victim of <unk> almost all of my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from various <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I found that one of the kids we had made friendship, was Jewish her.
I took several days to go out to the light this detail and I realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I'd never had a Jewish friend and frankly I felt very proud to have been able to overcome the barrier that all life had made me believe it was <unk>
Another crucial moment came when I got a summer work in Bush -- a park of <unk>
I found myself from people from all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental in the development of my character.
All of the life had taught me that <unk> was a sin and by extension, all gay people were bad <unk>
I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, on a show, and I could see that several of them were the most <unk> and less critics that had seen in life.
Having been a child, I developed a sense of empathy toward the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat people, exactly the way I would have wanted to be treated.
So I was able to contrast the stereotypes that they had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what it is to be familiar, but I know what is being <unk> for something beyond my control.
Then he came up with the <unk> <unk>
Every nights, Jon Stewart made me to be <unk> honest about my <unk> and I helped see that race of people, religious or sexual orientation has nothing to do with character.
In a lot of forms he became my shape -- at a moment when I was desperately <unk>
Sometimes the inspiration can come from the unexpected and that a Jewish comedian had had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> was not in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother on how I was changing my way to think, and she told me something to preserve my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with the tired eyes of someone who has suffered enough <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that point, I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all that hate in your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship to my father and start a new life.
So why did I go out and put myself in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope that someone, one day, which is to take the violence, I can hear my story and understand that there is a better way to be able to get me to this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get me <unk>
On the other hand, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against <unk>
I do it for the victims of terrorism and their loved ones for the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has produced in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism to speak against those acts, no sense, like rejection to the actions of my father.
With this <unk> I put myself here as proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race, which children don't have to follow the paths of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you all.  Thank you very much.
At this moment there is a film that projects in their minds.
It's an incredible movie.
It's in 3D and it has <unk> sound from what you hear and you see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your film has <unk> tastes and texture.
You feel your body, your pain, you're right, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, like your childhood when you project your eyes.
And it's constantly a voice <unk> in your conscious thought.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything directly.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of being human.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal movie you, you, you and tea.
There's nothing to make you more directly.
At least I know I have an awareness of your own.
I have no certainty that you are aware of.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we were not aware of anything in our lives, it would make sense or value.
But at the same time is the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why are we not just robots that we would have to produce the results without experiencing the movie <unk>
At this point, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate awareness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible for a science of consciousness.
The science, by nature, is objective <unk>
<unk> for nature, is <unk>
So there may never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost the entire 20th century, that vision.
psychology was studying behavioral behavior, the neuroscience of the brain is <unk> but nobody mentioned consciousness.
It even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the moment for science to express <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a <unk> of science work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in recent years was the pursuit of correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw something of this fantastic job that presented Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
Now we understand a lot better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a rocket science.
It's not a science science.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain by saying that this kind of work of neuroscience tells some questions that we want to explain consciousness. The questions about what certain areas of the brain make certain areas of the brain and what they are going on.
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
Not to offend the <unk>
There are no easy problem with consciousness.
Well, it doesn't happen to the real puzzle of this <unk> Why all of the entire physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there an internal <unk>
At this moment, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give them a few years to neuroscience.
It's going to turn it into another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like the <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all kinds of emergent behaviors -- how are we all kinds of emergent behaviors, how are we going to be adapted -- how are we adapting and adapt to the living organisms, all of these are questions about how target works.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a phenomenon -- how do we think about how we talk about, how to we talk about, how do we do <unk> are all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are among easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why everything is accompanied by an <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of the <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually still doesn't have a lot to say.
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk>
I want a scientific theory of the <unk> that work. For a long time, I would hit my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness at the <unk> of consciousness in pure physical terms that would work.
But at the end of the end, I came to the conclusion that it didn't work for reasons why it didn't work.
I think that we were going to focus on this point.
We have a wonderful explanations. We have a wonderful, cool problem: We were used to this, the physics explains the chemistry, the chemistry explains biology, biology explains the biology of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
We don't know how to put that idea to our scientific vision of the world.
I think consciousness right now is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate to our worldview, but we don't know how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at the beginning <unk> crazy before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today has one.
His crazy idea is that there's no such problem of consciousness.
The whole idea of the inner subjective movie includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
In fact, what you need to do, is to explain the functions of <unk> the behaviors of the brain, and so it studies everything that needs to be <unk>
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely <unk> consciousness, based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply denying that the observation of consciousness is pleasing
But I'm in a different direction.
In the time, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as <unk> <unk> space, time and mass.
It was fundamental laws that are <unk> like laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of the most basic things.
On the contrary, they think about principles, and that's what the world is constructed.
Sometimes the list of the fundamental thing is <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> discovered that you can't explain the electromagnetic phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- space mass, mass fiction mass, so I applied the basic <unk> of the <unk> and applied the electric charge as a fundamental concept that those laws <unk>
I think that's the situation that we find with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- space, time, mass, charge -- then by the matter of logic -- you have to <unk> the list.
The most natural would be <unk> the same as a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that all of a sudden it's not the object.
It opens the way to make it scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness, with other fundamental concepts -- space, time, the mass, physical processes.
physicists sometimes say that we want the fundamental laws of such simple laws that we can believe them in a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can find them in a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we're looking for.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Each system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> by all of us, <unk> -- every system is aware, not only humans, the dogs, the mice, the <unk> even the microbes of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be filled with distress when you think <unk> always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But the thought is that maybe photons can have some item of raw feeling -- some primitive precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little bit crazy for you.
How would someone think that <unk>
Part of this comes from the first crazy idea that consciousness is really critical.
If it's primal like space, the time and mass, is natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that even though the idea seems to us, it's much less for the people in different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
And a deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful form of finding fundamental laws to find fundamental laws that are thinking with the physical process, is <unk> the consciousness with information.
Because there's no information processing information, there's consciousness.
<unk> <unk> complex as in a human, <unk> complex.
<unk> of simple information, simple <unk>
One very exciting thing is that in recent years, a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory and developed <unk> with mathematicians.
It has an mathematical measure of information integration, which is <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated into a system.
And it was supposed to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information integration -- a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a kind of way of integration integration, as much significant, degree of consciousness quite important.
But when you get to the worms, microbes, particles particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is <unk> but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different level of <unk>
In fact, this is a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness to the physical world.
The physicists and the philosophers are often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but we don't talk about the reality underlying the reality underlying us.
As Stephen Hawking, "Where does the fire come from?
From <unk> vision, the equations of physics can be <unk> but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts it in the equations.
In that vision, consciousness doesn't find out of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there at the center.
So this vision -- I think, <unk> vision has the potential for <unk> our relationship to nature, and it can have very serious social and ethical consequences.
Some of them can be <unk>
I used to think that I didn't have to eat anything that had consciousness, then I must be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll have a lot of hungry.
I think it tends to transform your <unk> whereas what matters in terms of ethical and moral <unk> is not both the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask by consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What is about the artificial intelligence system in the movie <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of <unk> information, she has a complicated information processing.
If this is right, they have a fairly serious ethical problem about the development of development of smart computers and ethics of <unk>
Finally, you can ask for the consciousness of collective collective consciousness, the planet.
Canada has their own consciousness?
Or at a more local level, an integrated group as the audience at a TED Talk, and we have a collective collective consciousness, an internal movie for this full TED group of the internal movies of every single <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least a question that needs to take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's correct.
Actually, I'm more sure about the first crazy idea that consciousness is a fundamental thing, which is universal than the second idea.
So vision raises a lot of questions, many challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we go on the right way toward a theory of serious consciousness.
If not, well, that's probably the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it at night in the morning.
But I think we finally go to discover.
Understanding consciousness is the real key point, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the right crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village in Victoria.
He had a very normal profile an education profile.
I went to school, I was standing with my friends, I was standing with my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents, because I wanted to get a community in the community.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice -- but there's an obvious problem.
She's actually not <unk>  And they were right.
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a low profile on the <unk> of my mother, and spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yes, I know. What a contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing can be considered as an achievement if you take the disability outside the equation.
years later, I was in the second part of teaching at a high school school at a high school school, just after about 20 minutes in the class 11 minutes in the class 11 minutes in the class 11 minutes of <unk> a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when will your <unk>
And I said, "What?"
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for a good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people on the wheelchair, they talk about things like <unk>
Usually in the <unk> hall.
And it was then when I realized, this kid had had experiences with disability as objects of inspiration.
And we are not. And it's not from the boy, I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We are there to inspire us.
And in fact, I am on this stage <unk> to what I do in this wheelchair -- and you probably are waiting for you to get it? Right?
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid.
I'm not here for <unk>
I'm here to tell you that you have lied to our disability.
Yes, they have sold the lie that disability is something <unk> A <unk> A capital <unk>
Is it a bad thing and living with a disability that's a remarkable thing.
It's not a bad thing, and it can't make you happen.
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or is this <unk> "Before we <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there is a lot of them.
You may have seen one of the girl without drawing with a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a child running with carbon fiber <unk>
And there's a lot of these pictures, which is what we call the inspiration <unk>
And I use the term porn term -- because we <unk> a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, let's get the experience of people in the benefit of people without disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we can see them and think, "Well, for very bad that my life, it could be worse.
I could be that person."
But if you're that person?
I've lost the account of the number of times that I've been talking to strangers to express that believe that I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this happen before my work had a public profile.
It was like me to stand up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, these images are attached to people with disability in the benefit of people without disability.
You're there so you can see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put their concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a difficult thing.
So let's get a few things.
But the things that we overcome aren't the things that you can think of.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> I'm deliberately deliberately because I believe it called the social model of the disability, which tells us that we are more related because of the society that we live because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a very long time.
I'm very excited about it.
And the things that I need to do, and I've learned to get the best of your ability as well as you do, and that's what happens with the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside the common.
They're just using their bodies by taking their own best their ability.
So it's really just <unk> in the way we do that, when we share those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> says it as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lying, because they've been sold this lie that disability makes us quite remarkable.
And honestly, it doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration, and you think, "My God, you're not going to be inspired by something for anything?"
And actually, I know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability at all time.
And yet, I don't know that I am privileged to them.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use a <unk> <unk> to pick up the things that they fall around me,  -- <unk> the ingenious trick of how to load the battery on the cell phone on the chair.
Great.
We learn from the force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that that lie that have been sold about disability is the greatest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie is because it's not true, because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles to a string of steps has never done it becomes a <unk>
Never.   You know, <unk> on a television screen won't make the subtitles for people <unk>
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to turn all those books into the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I really want to live in a world where disability is not exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> is not considered not to be aware of anything for being on a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of the people with disability that we are <unk> to wake up the bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a child in the 11th grade in Melbourne is not a little surprised that his new teacher is a <unk>
<unk> don't make us <unk> but questioning what you think about what you do.
Thank you.
What do you have to do <unk> reality and professional <unk> with <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, today just to answer one of those questions, so that please don't get stuck.
When people think about <unk> they think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and will happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know, because augmented reality to change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how do we get to reality <unk>
The first step, is what I wear <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets them see what I see.
It will allow them to experience what is a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you would relate to your imagination.
We can use the Google Glass, underneath a helmet and know what it is to run through the <unk> <unk> the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like a <unk> man. <unk> trying to get rid of it all the way.
I've been there and I assure you that it's not nice.
So let's take a few videos to show you what the Google is using to use the Google <unk> under the shell, and giving them an idea of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of the practices of <unk> because the idea of the <unk> technology is an underwater moving up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's see a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
So a moment. Let's take a little.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is being <unk> in football, from the perspective of the <unk>
You may have noticed that you need people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, from the University of Washington.
<unk> of <unk> Mice -- listen to mice.
Blue 8, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more like being in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
They want that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field, be their favorite players and have asked me on YouTube and <unk> you can see from the angle of a field of <unk>
Or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we take it to the next <unk>
We took it at that level using something called <unk> <unk> which probably many of you know about.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic reality apparatus ever created, and it's not cheap.
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, <unk>
No, no, no! I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my God. Ah!
<unk> That is the experience of a man in a Russian mountain, <unk> for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan of a fan when you put a video of Adrian <unk> across the line, <unk> of a <unk> with the arm before you run and make a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan of a fan of it.
When it can be <unk> running by the <unk> launching the ball back into the bottom of the network?
Which will be your experience when you go from a mountain to more than 100 miles an hour like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe the sales of diapers for adults.
But this is not really <unk>
It's just virtual reality, it's true.
How do we get to reality <unk>
You know, <unk> reality when the <unk> <unk> and the owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to make <unk>
Because they always use the technology to gain.
They like to gain. They give them money.
So here's a brief monitoring of technology in <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> of Baltimore put a <unk> on his field and he would play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the game because it was more exciting, and it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> placed the <unk> on the <unk> of the <unk> and after the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was faster, more entertaining.
In <unk> imagine that they're a player coming back to his group, and you see the next move you see in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that takes a <unk> You don't have to worry about forget a <unk>
Or to memorize the strategy.
They just go out to the field and get it.
And the coaches want it because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose and they hate to lose games.
If you lose parties as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual <unk>
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your game <unk>
How would you do that?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every end of the stadium having a view from the top of the people that are down.
You also get information from the <unk> sensors and <unk> something that's already working on.
And all that information is sent to your players.
Good teams will know <unk>
The bad guys will have information overload
This is <unk> for good equipment.
So your computer team is going to be as important as your <unk> and the data analysis to stop it for nerds.
I will also be able to get <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the country?
Imagine that they're the <unk>
They had the ball and <unk>
So let's get an open receptor all of a sudden, a <unk> on the left side of your bombsight -- you would tell you that a defense behind you is going to <unk> you don't get it, but the <unk> system, you will give you.
They would take the protection.
Another <unk> <unk> that there's an open receptor
He <unk> the <unk> but they were <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where you can land, but the receptor sees it an area of grass an area of grass that lights up and you can modify the career.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> runs <unk>
The public <unk> and the fan has followed the move from each angle.
This is something that will create a massive emotion in the party.
I'm going to make lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of the sport because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
We're going to use it as a bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster empathy among human beings, to show someone how it is, literally, be in the other person's place.
We know what this technology is worth <unk>
It generates billions of dollars a year.
But how much is this technology for a professor in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad their actions are from the perspective of the <unk>
How much is this technology for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show you the world how you live <unk>
How much is it worth a <unk> <unk> or an Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science instead of <unk> notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, reality is coming.
The questions that we do, the choices we do and the challenges we face, <unk> as usual, of us.
Thank you.
I recently told me after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years ago, I got the country down the southern end of the Lofa County, which includes the Golden Golden <unk>
The bridge is an automatic structure that was known for its beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and its inspiring architectural <unk>
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most places used in the world.
The bridge Golden Survey was opened in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer, head of building the bridge, said that, "The bridge is pretty much to test <unk>
On suicide from the bridge is not practical nor <unk>
But from their openness, over 1,600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that traveling between the two towers will take it to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, so that every one of it frees you from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that go underneath your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After a fall of four to five seconds, the body hits the water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks out, the bones, some of which we have vital organs.
Most of them die in impact.
The ones who don't, usually they were <unk> in the water <unk> and then they <unk>
I don't think that you know, this suicide method is going to realize <unk> death that <unk>
This is cable wire.
Except about the two towers, there are 32 inches of parallel steel on the bridge.
This is where most people are going to take their life.
I can tell you the experience that once the person is on that edge, and at the darker time, it's very difficult to bring it back.
I took this picture last year while this young man was talking with an officer looking at his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had success that day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we had no formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who were born, but the officers as well.
We have come a long way since then.
Today, veterans and psychologists train the new government.
This is Jason <unk>
I met the age 22 of last year to get a call from a possible subject of a suicide subject sitting on the <unk>
<unk> and when I got there, I looked at Jason talking to a <unk> of the Golden Gate <unk>
Jason was only 32 years old, and he had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, there was flown up to here two times before New Jersey to try to get married from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> I asked you if we knew the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> the mythology of <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent the Earth to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> don't open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could get more than <unk> and she opened the box.
And she came out <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
And so Jason asked us, "What if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped a <unk> leaned on the right, and he left.
This kind and clever guy in New Jersey had just taken off his life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I suppose when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the family rabbi called me to see what it was.
The parents of Jason had done it.
damage damage from suicide affects a lot of people.
I put these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or somebody loved being <unk>
What would you say?
What do you say?
In my experience, there is not only to talk, but you need to listen.
Listening to understand.
Not <unk> or say to the person you know how it feels like it feels because you probably didn't get it.
You just stand there, you can be the tipping point that you need.
If you think someone is <unk> you're not afraid of <unk> and asking the question.
One way to ask you the question is: <unk> in the similar circumstances have thought about finishing their lifetime, you've had these <unk>
They took the person in front of the person in front of their life and to be the tipping point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believing the things are terrible and they're never going to make sure that there is nothing you can do in <unk> social <unk> and a losing interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read to you his letter.
She lost his son when she was 19th of January of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days ago, and it's with his permission and blessing that I read it.
"Hello, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to their friends that tell their friends, and so on.
I'm still quite <unk> but noticing more moments of realizing that Mike didn't go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the <unk> game, the 19 of January.
It never came there.
I called the police from <unk> and <unk> like disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officers came to my house and reported that Mike car was down in the bridge.
A witness had seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the day before.
Thanks very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been <unk> without having a real mental disease.
It must not be so easy to end up with it.
My prayers are with you for your fight.
The <unk> the Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not an <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and run the way his son took that day, and also the courage to go ahead.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March of March 2005, I wrote a call from a radio called a <unk> subject on the sidewalk near the northern tower.
<unk> my bike. I watched this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, they immediately cross the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
During the hour and a next half, I heard like Kevin talked about her depression and despair.
Kevin decided on his account that day to go back on that lane and give it another opportunity.
When Kevin came back, he <unk> it.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
And I said, "What was it that he did to <unk> and gave the hope of life and the other <unk>
And you know what told me?
He said, "Are you <unk>
I stopped talking and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the events in September 11, and you're one of the reasons that Kevin is still with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which has been properly <unk>
So Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious, of all of those traits -- but thank God, we now know it.
Kevin is in order, as it said.
We thank God for you.
I really miss debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end she wrote, <unk> When I visited the General San Francisco Hospital that night, you would wake up like the patient.
I knew I know what I had to do.
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father and an active member of society.
Talk about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that their story will inspire others.
suicide is not just something I've found at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather <unk> with poison.
That act, despite finishing his own pain, giving me the opportunity to meet him.
This is what suicide.
For most people <unk> or those who consider suicide, you wouldn't think you hurt another person.
They just want their own pain.
Typically, this is made only three things: sleep, or alcohol or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illnesses and called suicide calls around the bridge.
In those incidents I have been directly involved -- I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who told him about an hour.
During that time, I got rid of my hand in three times.
On the end, I looked at me, and he said, "I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people that we get to contact that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those few that have jumped from the bridge and lived and you can talk about it, that one or two percent, most people have said that the second one that leaves side the railing they realized they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge is not only connected to <unk> with San Francisco, but also the people.
That connection, or the bridge we do, is something that everyone and every one of us must be working on.
<unk> can be prevent.
There's help. There is hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you don't are, but on your inside you know what you are, and a question you tell you, how do you bother that?
I must be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model I felt that I eventually had a dream that had had since a child.
My outside finally <unk> with my inner truth, with my inner self.
For complicated reasons, the ones that I go later, when I look at this picture, I think, you got it up, you got it <unk>
But last October, I discovered that, <unk> I'm just beginning.
We all <unk> our families, our religion, our society, our time in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value.
These are people who always defy the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors, many of my friends, my even, ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called revelation.
This is mine.
I was introduced to be born because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, and I always wear this t-shirt on the head.
And my mom was going, "Why are you always wearing that t-shirt at the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew then how do we <unk>
The gender has always been considered a <unk> but now we know that, really, is something more complex and mystery now.
Because of my success, I would never let me share my story, not because I thought it will be what I'm wrong, but because of how the world deals with those of us who want to be <unk>
And every day I appreciate being a woman.
I have mom, Dad and a family who accept me as I am.
Many aren't so fortunate.
There's a long tradition in the Asian culture celebrating the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines that celebrated these puzzles.
I was in front of the scenario and I remember this beautiful woman came up in front of me, and I remember that moment as if something happened to me, this is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was still wearing man, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the principal of a liberal beauty competition.
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you been involved in the <unk> competition.
He said to me that if she <unk> she was responsible for the <unk> and the note, and that night, and that night, I won the bathroom, I won the <unk> and I got a third <unk> between 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not many people can say that their first work was from queen of beauty of beauty of women, but I can.
I also met the <unk> <unk> especially when they went to the remote provinces of the Philippines.
But most importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001 my mom. He had moved to San Francisco, he called me and told me that passed my statement of the green card that I could go to live in the U.S.
I was hooked.
I said to my mom, "Mom, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, I called me and said, "Do you know if you fall to the U.S., you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested to me that I was two <unk> to my name.
She also accompanied me when I was standing in Thailand to the 19 years.
It's funny that in some of the rural cities in Thailand do the most <unk> sophisticated surgeries and secure.
At the time in the U.S., it was necessary to be done before the name and gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's license with the name of <unk> and the <unk> of <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity document means to be able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly my fears saw <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and be model.
Many aren't so fortunate.
I think of this woman from <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York City who <unk> was living in his truth, but he <unk> her life.
For many of my community, that's the reality they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All of the 20 November, we do a global <unk> for the <unk> Day.
I'm on this scenario thanks to a long story of people who are <unk> and stood in front of injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth alone and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, not fear.
I'm here, <unk> so that someday there is no more than 20 <unk>
My deeper truth led me to accept what I am.
Would you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you --    <unk> <unk> Let me get a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Sure. First of all, to thank with all of my <unk>
My support network, my parents especially, my family, which is very strong.
I remember all the times that I've been to younger young women who have been <unk> and some times, when they called me and told me that his parents couldn't embrace it, I would take the phone, he called my mom and say, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it would work, it's only identity identity, that's what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we all had a gender assigned to birth, and what I'm trying to do is put on the table that some times that is not block, and that there should be a space that allowed people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be room for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thanks.
In a lot of <unk> and tribal societies, the parents are usually known for their kids, but I'm one of the few parents who is known for his daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign by defending their rights in the 2007. And when his efforts were <unk> the National Prize <unk> of the <unk> became very <unk> a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if we did a look at the history of mankind, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies, right from the very beginning, when at birth a girl, his birth was not <unk>
It's not welcome, no because of his father, not by his mother.
The neighborhood comes back, he gives her <unk> to the mother and nobody <unk> the father.
And a mother got a lot of <unk> a lot to have a child.
When he comes to light to the first child, the first child, he gets sad.
When he gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a son, when he <unk> his third daughter, he feels guilty like a criminal.
Not only is the mother suffering, but the daughter. The daughter was <unk> when it grows, it suffers too.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, it stays home and the school is a high school to her brothers.
Up to the age of 12 years, in some sense, has a good life.
You can <unk>
You can play with your friends on the street, and you can move around the streets as a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, when it comes up 13 years old, you get an indicator of your house without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of your house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes the honor of his father and his brothers and his family and his family, and if we were <unk> the code of that honor, he could even kill.
And it's interesting that this kind of honor code, not only affects the life of a <unk> also affects the lives of the male members of the family.
So this brother <unk> the joys of his life and the happiness of their sisters in the name of the honor.
And there's a more rule of <unk> societies, which is called <unk>
It's supposed to be a good girl must be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It is supposed to be silent and who accepts the choices of their father and her mother and the <unk> decisions even if they don't.
If you put it with a man who doesn't like or if you put it with an old man, you have to <unk> because it doesn't want to be <unk>
If the <unk> very young, it has to embrace it.
Otherwise, <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In words of a <unk> "The <unk> and then it gives birth to more and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson of <unk> to his daughter and the same thing for honor to their children.
And this vicious circle continues and continues.
They were <unk> brothers and sisters, when he was born <unk> and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the newborns, to be honest, but when I was there, and I looked at his eyes, believe me, I felt incredibly <unk>
And so much before I came back, I thought of his name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of the freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> and he called my daughter so much.
But when I came back, everyone was men, and I grabbed my pen, and I took a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when she was like, when I was four and a half years and a half and a half years old, the <unk> in my school.
You might ask, why should I mention a child of a child in a school?"
Yes, I must <unk>
You can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in the poor societies, in tribal societies, it's a great event for the life of a child.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of their identity and their name.
One of the school at school means that it has entered the world of dreams and aspirations where it can explore their potential for future life.
I have five sisters, and no one of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when they were <unk> the form of <unk> and was the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was that I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason for the value of my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters and his daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
The <unk> to sit with me when my friends came to me.
The encouraged to go with me at different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to lie on his personality.
And it wasn't just for her, just for <unk>
I've got all these good values in my school to girls and boys alike.
I used education for <unk>
I taught my daughters, I taught students to forget the lesson of <unk>
I taught the students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
They were <unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of the involvement of women in all political and economic activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls are banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to markets.
The musicians were <unk> the <unk> girls and the singers were <unk>
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was terrifying to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really terrifying.
At 10 years old, I got up and got up on the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the BBC, blog and he was offered a day for the documentaries of the New York Times and talked about every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It was <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban could not tolerate his campaign and the nine o'clock in October 2012, was shot at <unk> on the head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
While my daughter was <unk> between the life and the death, I was beating by the ear of my wife "I must stand for what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> said, "Please don't bother you."
It was the right thing.
<unk> your life in the cause of peace, because of the cause of peace, and because of education, and your daughter inspired you to you and <unk>
They were both on the right way and God <unk>
These few words would be a lot to me, and I didn't go back to ask again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and had severe headaches and strong headaches because his facial nerve, was down, I used to see a dark shadow that goes through the face of my wife.
But my daughter never <unk>
I used to ask myself, "I'm okay with my smile, <unk> and the <unk> in my face.
I'm going to put it right. Please don't get paid.
It was a comfort for us, and we were <unk>
You know, <unk> brothers and sisters, we've learned from her how to resist in the hardest moments and I'm pleased to share with you that despite being an icon for children's rights, and women, is like any <unk>
<unk> when you don't finish his task.
They fight with his brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What is there in my <unk> which has made so bold to <unk> so brave and expressive and <unk>
I say, don't ask me what I did.
I did what I didn't do.
He didn't cut his wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> in the brain 18 years ago, and since that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you that recently I've joined the group of Google, where I have had a <unk> to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> but all the work I'm talking about today about the science of the brain, I made it before I met Google or outside my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you get it to a brain operation when you get it to a brain operation when you get it to a brain operation when you get it to a brain operation when you get it to a brain operation when you get it to a brain operation when you get it to a brain operation when you get it to a brain
You're still just as smart or not?
It's not going to be like this, you'll be intelligent again.
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray, matter, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
And then after the operation, I had to decide how much to take, from more than a dozen chemical powerful every day, because if I didn't take anything to die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about all 18 years, and you mix of chemical plates, and try to get it alive.
I have been saved by little.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided it was going to be able to try and get the fatal dose -- because there is no one map that tells you in <unk>
I started to test with different <unk> and I was struck by looking at how little tiny changes in the dose, dramatically -- my sense of who I was like, my way to think, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I had a dose of music and some typical chemical <unk> and I was surprised by looking at how I had my thoughts.
I was always thinking, I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the most intelligent person around the world, and --  of course, many times in the past I've met various kinds of things, or maybe some versions of them.
It turned out as a extreme.
But my big surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was actually <unk> a lot of <unk> to fix a problem that had on the front, and it just didn't happen that way.
So I couldn't manage it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation of the men and what they have to do -- I've been getting better with men.
What was trying to make those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, was to regain my intelligence after the disease and <unk> my creative, creative thinking, my flow of ideas.
We think almost always in pictures, and that became my point of key reference, how to make those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were <unk> new ideas and <unk> situations.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> see things like this.
They thought that images and mental ideas were the same thing.
There is the ones who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the mind works, to me is very simple: for most of us, the mental images are fundamental for <unk> and <unk> thinking.
So, after several years, I got to find the point right now, and I have a lot of great mental <unk> really sophisticated <unk> very sophisticated <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to bring these mental images of my mind to the computer screen of my mind.
Can you imagine what would happen if a director of cinema was able to use their imagination only to lead the world to the world.
Or if a musician could get the music out of his head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, as the way that creative people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to do this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we are pretty close to getting to this with two recent experiments that were done by two groups that were made by two groups that are leading by the <unk>
They both used MRI technology, an image of functional MRI -- to represent the brain here, and you can see the brain scanning by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scanning of the brain of a person who looks at an image.
The <unk> column shows the scanning of the brain of that same individual.
The column on the right was created <unk> the contents of the central column of the left -- you see the difference is almost <unk>
This is <unk> in many different individuals with lots of different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image and imagining that same image is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from the <unk> <unk> lab in Berkeley, California.
They managed to turn the brain waves into the visual fields.
Let's put it this way.
In this experiment, they showed up the people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they were attached to their brains to create a great monitor of the brain to the video sequences.
And then I showed you a film with new images, new people, new animals, and as long as we get a new <unk>
The computer using only the brain information scanning the scanning thing to show what it seemed like the person was looking at.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This blew us up.
We're very good at doing this.
We just need to make the resolution.
And now, remember, when you see an image and when you look at that same picture, you believe in the brain the same <unk>
This was done with the brain scanning systems of more resolution available today, and their resolution for a thousand times a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution about a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do we get it?
There are lots of techniques to do it.
One is to open the skull and you put your electrodes.
I don't offer it for that.
A lot of them are proposing new projection techniques -- even me, <unk> with the recent outcome of the MRI -- first we need to ask the next, this technology will be the end of the <unk>
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get most resolution is with larger magnets -- but at this point, magnets more <unk> only offer little improvements in the resolution, not increases by thousands of such as we need.
I propose this idea, instead of larger magnets -- make better magnets better.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different arrangements like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
Over the last few years, a huge amount of effort in MRI were to make magnets really big, right?
But most of the recent advances in the recent advances in <unk> of clever and brilliant solutions on <unk> and <unk> and <unk> radio shows, in MRI systems.
At their time, instead of a magnetic field, they were also going to be able to prescribe magnetic patterns of magnetic patterns by <unk> into the radio frequencies of <unk>
So by combining magnetic patterns with the patterns of the radio radio processing patterns -- we can increase massive amounts of information that you can extract in a single <unk>
Also, we can then split into layers our growing knowledge on the structure of the brain and memory to create the increase in the thousands that we need.
By using the <unk> we should be able to measure not only the blood of the blood -- but the ones of the hormones and <unk> that I mentioned and perhaps even neural neural activity -- this is sleep.
Will we be able to <unk> our ideas in direct shape to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go over the language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is big.
These are great questions.
It would be <unk> as a tool to amplify our thinking skills, and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's and similar diseases.
We have more choices than open this door.
Anyway, you choose a year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine it will take a lot more.
We need to learn how to give this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just about the gay gay.
I think we all have <unk>
His closet may probably be telling someone for the first time that loves him or telling someone who's pregnant, or telling someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation that you have to do in life.
And all of my things is a difficult conversation, and although our issues can vary <unk> the experience of I've lived and have come out of that closet is universal.
It's afraid, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I worked on the South Side <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and I was there, I had to go through several stages of the intensity of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my armpits, quote from <unk> gave <unk> as a <unk>
And I'm going to be slope with the <unk> of my <unk> and because I got my head on a little bit, I would ask you a little bit, usually a child -- "Hey, you're a kid or <unk>
And it would be a awkward silence at the table.
<unk> my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with one of <unk>
The father was <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother was tossed a cold look at his son.
But I wouldn't say anything, and I would go on it inside.
And I came to the point that every time I was going to a place where there was a kid in between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself that the next time I would say something.
I would have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
It was a family silence, but this time I was prepared and I was about to get on the feminine issues on the table --  I had the quotes by Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Even a glimpse of the "Vagina Monologues" that I <unk>
And so I went down to a deep cut and I went down to my back and my back -- a 10-year-old girl with an pink, looking at what is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> only one girl with a question: "You're a kid or <unk>
And then I took it back to a profound thing, and I set up with <unk> near her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is something troubling.
I have the short hair like a boy, and I saw her clothes, but I'm a girl, and you know, as you like to use a pink dress and sometimes you like to use a comfortable <unk>
I am more from a girl from a <unk> pajamas.
And that girl looked at me and looked at me by paying attention, and he said, "My favorite <unk> is <unk> and it has a fish.
You can give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was all -- they just said, "Well, you're a girl.
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the easiest difficult conversation ever ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl in the <unk> and I, two, we went <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I have lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But in the dark, you can't know what color the walls.
You just know how a feeling feels like in a closet.
That's how my closet is not different than you or yours or yours.
Let me give you a hundred reasons why you get out of my closet was harder to come out of his, but this is the <unk> The hard thing is not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me that to explain to someone who have declared online banking is harder than to say it has been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell you is harder to tell your five-year-old child than you are going to get paid.
There's no more difficult, there's only the hard thing.
We need to stop classifying what it is difficult for us to think about what difficult for another person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we must only feel empathy because we all live a hard thing.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and you can make them feel security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls, a closet is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, who had a horse, a horse, a dress and <unk> shoes.
It wasn't the militant lesbian lesbian prepared to fight against any four years that would go into coffee.
I was frozen because of the fear of my dark closet -- my grenade gay, and the moving one is the most scary thing I've ever done.
My family, my full strangers that I've spent my entire life trying to <unk> and now the world was turned around purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we've all followed for so long, but if you don't toss that <unk> to kill you.
One of my most memorable grenade launches was in my sister for my sister.
It was the first time that many guests knew that I was gay, and I was doing my <unk> <unk> in my black dress and <unk> walked around the tables and I finally came to one where my friends were my parents' friends, people who knew me for years.
And after talking about a moment, one of the women screamed at <unk> <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
Have you ever heard of it once you were in the <unk>
"Well, yes, the truth is that we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never been there, but we heard it is <unk>
<unk> You know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about <unk>
What is your favorite TV show.
Our favorite <unk> Will and Grace program.
And you know who gives us <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but I hope I desperately show his support, to make me know that I was on my side, he finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband is wearing shirts <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that moment, as you have all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very difficult to find them and realize that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with someone, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing that you want.
That's how hard conversations are still my strong point.
Ask anybody that I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I keep what I like to call the three principles of <unk>
Now, please see this through the gay perspective, but understand that what it means to go out of any closet is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be authentic.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in the coffee had no armor but I was ready for the battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> others must know we also suffer.
Number two: Be a <unk> Just <unk> <unk> your <unk>
If you know they are gay, <unk>
If they say their parents who might be gay, they would keep the hope that that could change.
They don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex.
You communicate your truth.
It would never be done by that.
And some of you can go out safe hurt by what you've done, but I'm never sorry for what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you will feel <unk> but that's something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not of you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you find in a dark way, <unk> a <unk> must know that we've all been there before.
And it may feel very yourself, but they don't.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
So what is that?
If you look at the story of how the intelligence has been seen -- a productive example has been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> that "The question of if a machine can think about is as interesting as the question of whether an submarine can be made.
When I was <unk> <unk> he wrote this as a criticism of the computer pioneers like Alan <unk>
And so a few years ago, I took a program to try and understand the fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
Let's go back a step.
We start with a mental experiment.
So imagine that you're from an alien race that you didn't know about the biology of the Earth or the Earth of Earth or the Earth or the Earth or you can see the Earth, and you can see the Earth, and you have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as a <unk> we know the reason that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from an alien race that doesn't know anything about this, which has no concept about the Earth, you would see it forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, to a certain time in time, the asteroids that we prescribe the surface of a planet -- they stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question to understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that led to a number of years ago, I studied a variety of issues through science, through several disciplines, that <unk> I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be accurately adjusted for the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of universal states that <unk> the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in the planning of robotic movement, there have been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the ability of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so taking all these different issues and <unk> together, I said, for several years ago, there is a mechanism underlying the intelligence that we can get from all these different <unk>
There's only one equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent of a E = <unk> for intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're seeing here is an claim that intelligence is a strength, F, that acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or to keep the open choices with a force T, with the diversity of potential future accessible, yes, to an impending future, <unk>
In a nutshell, intelligence does not like to get <unk>
intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and keep the options open.
And so you have to see this equation, it's natural to ask, what can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the human <unk>
<unk> artificial intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, will show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that universes that produce more disorder, or <unk> during their life should have tendency to conditions more favorable to the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that <unk> connection is between the entropy and <unk> intelligence, a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlates with the production of entropy in the long term, but actually arises directly from it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy in any system where you can find inside.
<unk> <unk> was able to spend multiple animal <unk> play games, and even make money <unk> actions, and all of it didn't have been able to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a foot of foot without <unk> here we see <unk> <unk> a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable partly because we never gave him a goal.
He just decided to figure out the <unk>
This ability of equilibrium will have applications for robotic robotics and human technology.
This ability to use tools will have applications in smart manufacturing and agriculture.
Also, just like some other animals can cooperate by pulling off extreme sides of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can make a version of the model of that task.
This ability of cooperation has really interesting consequences for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applied to a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see successfully playing a <unk> game, <unk> their potential for play.
Here we see <unk> initiating new connections into a social network where the friends are constantly moving and keeps the net well connected to the right thing.
This same <unk> capacity of network also has applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a fleet of boats, and discovering success and using the Panama Canal to expand the world level from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable in defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discover and run a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a simulated hardware <unk> set of actions, successfully increasing assets under their exponentially.
This risk app will have huge applications in finance and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of marks of intelligent cognitive behaviors, such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation -- all derive from a single equation, that leads to a system to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
So back to the beginning of the use of the term -- the <unk> work -- there was always the concept that if we <unk> intelligent machines, there would be a <unk> rebellion, there would have been <unk>
Machines are going against us.
One of the greatest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all the concept of rebellion <unk> the other way.
It's not that machines first become smart, and then they go back, and they try to take over the world.
It's everything else that the urge to take control of all future future is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence, that general intelligence can actually emerge from taking control instead of the other way around.
Another important consequence is the search for the goal.
They often ask me, "How do you look for goals to learn from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent of that statement to move the descendants to help them build artificial intelligence, or to help them build artificial intelligence -- is this: intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid the restrictions in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at an inflection point in human history, something between the <unk> of stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Even in the last few years, we have extended our knowledge of how the Earth fits the Earth in the context of the universe.
The NASA mission of NASA has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, what points the Earth is only one among the billions of the planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the acoustic intensity of the stars when the planets go ahead of them, and they block a little bit of that light that we go.
The data gathered by Kepler showing the sizes of planets in addition to the distance that there is between them and their mother.
In together, this helps us understand whether these planets are little and <unk> like the ground planets in our solar system, and also the amount of light that they receive from their own.
At the time, this gives clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this trove of potentially <unk> worlds that our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The <unk> year was the most hot, recorded.
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us since we've been doing now that it has been disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused on a global scale have <unk> our ability to disrupt their course.
But I'm not a weather scientist or a weather scientist or <unk>
I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with the hope to find places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You could say I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, like someone very interested in the search for life in the universe can tell you that the more I look for planets like the Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet and the planets that we know better -- the from our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor Mars.
Mars is little and <unk> and despite being a little bit further from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially livable world to prove this by a mission like the Kepler <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and, in part, it's why we study both to Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> trace its surface in search of the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> mission takes samples of the <unk> atmosphere, and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
private companies now offer not only short space flights but also the <unk> <unk> of living on Mars.
But even though all of these images, <unk> remind us the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with ideas and <unk> and compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that are still due to <unk> places -- compared to Mars.
Even in the most dry and highest places on Earth is cool and full of oxygen filled with our rain forests at thousands of miles away.
I worry that this enthusiasm for the colonization of Mars and other planets to <unk> and the implication of the implication and the belief in some of Mars that Mars is waiting for us to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know that it's truly livable the Earth.
So so much that I like exploration exploration, I'm deep to disagree with this idea.
There are lots of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to help humanity is to imagine that the captain of the Titanic is like to imagine that the captain of the Titanic will have place later on the <unk> <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for <unk> exploration, and land preservation is not <unk>
No, it's actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding, to preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments in our world look like <unk> aliens.
They just find them closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and keep <unk> spaces in the hostile and <unk> areas of land, maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
So let me leave you with an experiment, <unk> paradox <unk>
Many years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi asked the fact that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there were a lot of planets in this universe, we should have found the evidence of alien life until now.
Well, where are they?
Well, a possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become good advanced enough to keep living between the stars, they lose the notion of how important that is to protect the origin of the planets that will be <unk> this development.
It's arrogant to think that we just extended colonization to save ourselves of ourselves, but the planetary preservation and exploration, can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to impact the hostile environments of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
And a few years ago, I would get my own home.
And as I was on the front porch looking in my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window out of the dining table where there were <unk>
So quickly I tried to open all the other doors and windows, and they were all closed.
I thought I would call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get it up, and it was cold.
I couldn't go home from my friend of Jeff to spend night because he had an early flight to Europe in the next morning, and my <unk> and my suitcase.
They are expensive, but they certainly didn't get more expensive than a half to a half to a half a half a half a half a half night, so I thought, despite the circumstances, I have worked right out.
I'm a profession and I know a little bit about how the brain is under stress.
<unk> <unk> who increases heart rate -- <unk> levels of adrenaline and <unk>
And when I came to the <unk> counter at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something that could be done, systems that could put in place, that <unk> that were going to happen.
Or at least if bad things happen to be bad things -- you know, the likelihood that it's a total catastrophe happening.
So I got to think about that, but until one month later, my thoughts did not <unk>
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed he told him that I broke the window, and that I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me who had been practicing something called <unk> hindsight of the <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written about this a few years before, known as <unk>
You all know what the <unk> is.
Every time there is a disaster, a team of experts come and try to figure out what went wrong, right?
In the <unk> like <unk> you look forward and you're trying to figure out all the things that you might go wrong, then you try to figure out what it can do to prevent things to happen or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk about is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> they're not so evident.
I'm going to start with obvious.
In the house, it would be a place for things that are very easily.
This sounds common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to make a track of the location of the important things, where the hope is right, where the fish, which lies the <unk> trees where the female tribes live and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that is <unk> in the <unk>
It's the part of the brain that lets the <unk> find their nuts.
And if someone really did the experiment, they cut the sense of <unk> <unk> and they could still find their nuts.
They didn't use the nose, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism.
But it's really good for things that don't move too much, not so good for things that move too much.
This is the reason for losing your car and reading and <unk>
So at home you get a place for your keys, a hook along the gate, maybe a <unk>
For your passport, a particular drawer for your passport.
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you take a place and be <unk> with it, your things will always be there when you <unk> them.
What about the <unk>
Take the cell phone a picture of your credit cards, your credit card cards, your head <unk> for yourself to be in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> it can facilitate the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, your brain releases you.
<unk> is toxic and <unk>
So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we will not be at the best time, and you have to put the systems on the site.
And there's perhaps no more stressful situation than when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we all will be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or the one to be dear to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> like a <unk> for all decision-making, and in fact for the making of social decisions and in fact for social decisions and any kind of decision that we have to take from that that would benefit a rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and the cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
Everybody knows that high cholesterol cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart disease, attack the heart attack.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to give you a drug that will help reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you have heard of the <unk> and you know it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today -- even you are likely to know people that <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you have to do then, a statistic that is supposed to ask that most physicians don't want to speak and companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number you need to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or to have a surgery in any medical procedure before you can help a person.
And you must think about what kind of statistical statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't give me something if I wasn't going to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work that way.
And it's not the doctor, and if it is <unk> it's from the scientists like me.
We didn't understand very well the mechanisms that are <unk>
But the <unk> estimates that 90 percent of drugs are only about 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number you need to treat the most widely <unk> What do you think it?
How many people have to take it before to help somebody give somebody to help a person?
300.
This is the research on the research of the cynical researchers <unk> and Pamela <unk> independently <unk>
I just explored the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before a year before we had a heart attack or a <unk> event.
Now maybe you might think, "Well, one probability in 300 than my <unk>
Why do not, <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more statistical statistic and you have to get rid of the effects of <unk> Yeah?
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced in five percent of the patients.
And those include things that are <unk> <unk> muscle pain and <unk> pain -- but now they're thinking, "I'm five percent likely to happen to me, still take the <unk>
But a moment.
remember, under stress you don't think clearly.
So think of the way that you can do this over time, so you don't have to make the supply chain of reasoning on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has been <unk> five percent of the 300 people have a side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to go out of the drug to help you the drug.
I don't say they had or not <unk>
I just say you must have this conversation with your doctor.
Social ethic is a part of the principle of informed consent informed leaders.
We have the right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the value value, but actually this necessary number to treat is quite typical.
For the surgery that most of the biggest men in the top of 50 percent of prostate cancer, the number we need to deal with is <unk>
So this is 49 surgeries for one person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case are produced in 50 percent of patients.
They include the telltale or dysfunction <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you are lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before the questions that you can assume that we would take the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this stuff on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice many times, you want a shorter life of pain, or a longer life than I could have a lot to the end?
These are the things they speak and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change the heat of the moment, but unless you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Do you face it with a dinosaur, you don't need the immune system, or the <unk> or the immune system, because if your body is spending the metabolism on those things, it doesn't react very quickly. You might get to the lunch of the lions, so nothing that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that's going through the window during those moments of stress is the kind of rational thought like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown the time.
So we need to be able to think about the future to these kinds of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We're all going to fail at a time.
The idea is to think about the future, how could those <unk> to put the systems in the place that will help us minimize harm, or to prevent the bad things on the first place.
I went to the snow night in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor I installed a combination of combination along the door, with a key to the gate of the gate in the same way, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters that I haven't ordered and lots of email messages that I haven't seen.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization like a <unk> process and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite symbol.
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play <unk>
Two <unk> even more gentle.
Four <unk> extremely gentle.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there you see that it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can never be done to a complete silence.
That is my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound of <unk>
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The language of French signs came over the decade of 1800s, and with the time time they mixed with local signs, and they developed the language that we know as a <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and I was taught to believe that sound wasn't a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
But now I realize it's not true for anything.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a world of sound, it's like me if I lived in a foreign country -- following <unk> their rules, <unk> behaviors and <unk> norms.
So how do I understand the sound <unk>
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
It will be <unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I've learned for example.
"Don't <unk> the <unk>
"Don't do much noise when you eat the bag of potato <unk>
"Don't <unk> and when you're eating, you didn't get <unk>
I call it <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think about the sound tag more than the average person does it.
I'm super <unk> of sounds.
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound that's going to come next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk>
It will be <unk>
<unk> for <unk>
You can see the <unk> has no notes on the lines.
That's because the lines contain sound through the <unk> subtle and <unk>
In <unk> culture, movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
And yet, for me, to do it with my thumb that's not natural.
That's why I have four lines on the paper.
In the year 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic and an artistic house.
Before this time, I had worked like <unk>
During this summer, I visited different <unk> of different <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that moment, the sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now sound has entered my territory of art.
Is it going to give me more than art?
I realized that it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know that well that they don't only experience through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or experience visually, or even like an idea.
So I decided to reclaim sound ownership and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And everything that they had taught me about the sound, I decided to leave it and get it back.
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was struck with the amount of support and attention that I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, the <unk> social currency.
At the bottom of my mind, I always felt that sound was <unk> it was a <unk> thing.
And the sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my artistic job, or I could give it to me.
I chose to stand up.
There's a massive culture around the speech language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like he didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me like and become my voice.
So I'm able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, in school, and institutions, work with many different performers from <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking for <unk> their voices, I'm able to keep a temporary form of value something like taking a loan with a very high interest rate.
If I'm not going to continue with this practice, I feel like I could <unk> it in the <unk> and not have any social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium of the music.
And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note cannot be capturing and express on the paper.
And the same thing can be said about a concept in <unk>
The two are very highly <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all meaning as much of the signals like sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, so you understand better how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> are divided into many different parameters different ways.
If it's <unk> a different <unk> for every finger while you touch the piano, like the facial expression, the movement of the body, the way of the body and so as the piano, as the piano, the English is a linear language, as if you look at it just a key time.
However, the <unk> is more like a <unk> they need the 10 fingers, they need to express a concept of the concept or an idea of <unk>
If I just would change the <unk> it would create a completely different meaning of it.
The same thing with music in terms of tone and volume.
In <unk> when we use these different parameters we can be able to express different ideas.
For example, the signal <unk> in that."
This is the <unk> signal in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Ah, <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I see the <unk> through the lens of music?
If I had to create a sign and take it over and again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
So for example, this is the <unk> sign of the sun, and it goes on.
This is "All day."
If you get it, and <unk> the visually speed, you see as a piece of music.
The whole day.
I feel that the same thing can be said to say <unk>
"All <unk>
This is all night in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different kinds of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how the time is expressed in <unk> and how the distance to the body can express the changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is one hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present more close and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
And then <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one that is my favorite, with a very romantic idea, a very romantic idea at the time, <unk>
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific pace of four times a <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically at <unk> same time."
Look at <unk> right, <unk> right hand.
We have the <unk> across the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> E, <unk> <unk> I'm going to show you a form of your hand called <unk> <unk>
Can you do this with me?
All of our hands in high hands.
Now we're going to do it both in the head like the chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yes, very good.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool for helping to communicate in all cultures and the languages of signs around the world.
The second one I would like to show you is this -- please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in <unk>
Now, the third. Please take it again.
And again.
It's <unk> in <unk>
Let's do three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good work.
Look at how three signs are very similar. They all happen on the head and the chest but they carry it very different.
It's incredible to see how the <unk> is alive and thriving like music.
However, today, we live in a very unequal world.
And just because the <unk> has no sound, it has no social value.
We need to start to question what the social value defines and allow the <unk> to develop their own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people will understand that you don't have to be deaf, to learn how to be <unk> I don't know that you have to hear music.
<unk> is a rich trove of trove of trove and I'd like to have the same experience.
I'd like to take you to open his ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, they can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would tell me, "You can <unk> everything, but then you have to <unk>
Freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination took me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence or a bubble of ignorance -- I must say, because adults would lie to us to protect us from the awful truth.
When I got older, I learned that adults also <unk> and that they're not very good to clean the other people.
The time happened, now I'm an adult teaching and invention in the <unk> school of Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait long for my students to walk down the beach with lots of waste.
So as a good citizens, we cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't get it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's kind of creepy.
And in the last decades, we have been coming out with these big ships and networks, to gather those pieces of plastic to look at the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts for an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky to use these huge ships.
So along with my students, ages six to 15 years, we dream about invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> <unk> job so that the kids very <unk> can also participate.
And I'll tell you the kids who manipulate the electrical tools feel cool, safe.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect the plastic and we cut it into the size we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
We do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to <unk> in something we hope to work.
We decided that instead of collecting pieces of plastic, we just bring information out.
Through the use of a robot, we take a picture of this <unk> kids get very excited with the robots.
Then we create quickly what we call "a <unk>
We're so fast at creating prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we turned lamps and online camera cameras around it and put it in a floating robot that is moving slowly through the water and the plastic that we have there, and this is the picture of it actually captured by the robot.
We see the pieces of plastic floating slowly through the sensor while the computer on board process this picture and measure the size of every single <unk> to get an estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
I would take this invention to step on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone will take it even more.
The cool thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to fix it immediately.
I am able to investigate my problem -- but my students in Hong Kong are very <unk>
You see the news news, <unk> the Internet, and you get <unk> with this image.
A child, perhaps lower than 10 years ago, cleaning up a oil spill, only using the hands of the <unk> the largest <unk> forest in the world in Bangladesh.
They were very shocked because this is the water that <unk> is the water where the water <unk> the water where they live.
You can also see the water is brown and the oil is brown and the oil is also brown color, and when all of the mix is <unk> it's very hard to see what there is in the water.
But there is a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a very first prototype of a <unk> which can be deployed through all kinds of substances that make different <unk> which can help identify what's in the water.
We took this prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
The cool thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
I got a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit further, and I want to go a little bit more difficult and also to address a harder problem and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and French and perhaps remember, in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it started various giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> destroy various cities on the east of Japan.
Over 14 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant from Fukushima a nuclear center near the water.
And today, according to the reports of 300 tons is still leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, all the entire Ocean Ocean has traces of pollution with <unk>
If we go to the west coast, we can measure the radiation of <unk> everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it looks like most of the radiation -- it looks like most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast, and most of the time, it has really safe it is blue.
Well, the reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year from the accident and research with other scientists, the soil, the river, and we wanted to carry the kids.
Of course, not <unk> the parents didn't do it.
But every night in the center of <unk> here you see the use of different masks here.
It could seem like they didn't take the serious work, but they did it because they're going to have to live with the <unk> all their life.
Together with them we discussed data that day and talk about what we were going to do afterwards, the strategies, the <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the power plant.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> <unk> for representing data in real time of <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
With this we were able to notice that the radioactive dust is <unk> from the top of the mountain into the <unk> system, and <unk> in the ocean.
It was <unk>
But based on this we organize an civil expedition -- the nearest of nuclear central to date.
We are approaching 1.5 miles of the nuclear center, and with the <unk> help of the area we were collecting sediments from the sea floor with a little bit of tracking sediment and we invent and we build.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open source technologies and very simple.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage that we've done.
We haven't even begun to deal with the problems.
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent better ways to do all these things.
So the classroom became a little bit small so we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we turned it into the greatest space dedicated to social and environmental impact.
It's in the heart of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal chemistry, a little bit of biology, from optical fibers, basically, you can build almost everything there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can become really with the help of adults, and where adults can be children again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
So for example.
Or, we can help in the mobility of the age population, transforming its standard wheelchair into new self-driving cars.
The plastic, the oil and the <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our kids are lies.
We cannot afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So as scientists, creators, creators, we need to prepare the next generation for the environment and people, and so I can really do something about it.
Thank you.
Two domes of <unk> two different cultures of design.
One is made out of thousands of pieces of steel, the other one of a silk debris.
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic one.
A <unk> on the environment, the other thing I thought of.
One is designed by nature, the other one for it.
Miguel angel said that when he looked at the Reagan called, saw a figure that is fighting for being free.
The <unk> was only one for Michelangelo.
But living creatures are not <unk>
They grow up.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we have all the information needed for every cell to work and for <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and mass production.
The dotted lines have dictated a world made out of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and trained architects, to think of their objects like <unk> of parts -- with different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think of human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk> ancestors.
The skins of the back are <unk> with little <unk>
One is acting primarily like filter the other largely as a barrier, and yet, it's the same <unk> there is no <unk>
It's a system that changes its functionality through variation.
Here's a broken screen that represents my view of the world -- the double <unk> of every designer and architect to work on between the <unk> and the gene, between the machine and the organism, between the assembly and the growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and right, analytics and synthesis, it shows up on the two screens after me.
My work, on his simplest level, trying to bring these two visions of the world, moving from assembly and getting growth.
You probably ask yourselves why now?
Why wasn't it possible about 10 or even five years ago?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare moment, where you have four disciplines that offer access to access to the tools that we never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I believe we create.
Please know the minds and my students' hands.
We designed objects, products, structures and tools at the scale of a huge scale, like this robotic arm with a reach of 24 meters in diameter with a base that gives some day not very far to print <unk> buildings, and the nanoscale facts made out of genetically genetically modified buildings.
Here we have <unk> the <unk> a archetype of the ancient Arab War, and it has created a screen where every aperture is only size to shape the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> that was for a <unk> fashion fashion fashion -- they're going <unk> It's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in flexible <unk> around the waist.
Along with 3D printing collaborator -- we printed this layer and slowed down it with no seams between the cells, I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines rigid and <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
Is it also the resolution of a CT scanner, too.
That designers have access to this high resolution of <unk> and the <unk> instruments allow us to design products that are <unk> not only the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We also designed an acoustic chair a chair at the time as comfortable as comfortable and also it absorb sound.
The medical professor, my collaborator came back to nature to <unk> and by designing this pattern of surface surface, it becomes <unk>
We put this surface of 44 different properties, which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> the pressure points in the human body.
Its surface, as in nature, vary its functionality not through the addition of another material or another <unk> but <unk> continuously and <unk> the material.
But it's the <unk> nature.
There is no parts of nature?
I didn't raised in a religious home, but when I was young, my grandmother would tell me the stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them came to me and came to define a lot of what I care about.
As she said, "In the third day of the <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a tree called <unk> <unk>
For that first <unk> tree there would be no difference between trunk, and leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a piece of fruit.
Instead, the land was growing trees with twigs, cortex, <unk> and flowers.
The land created a world made out of parts.
I often ask myself, "What would be the design if objects were made of a single test.
<unk> a better state of <unk>
So we look for the material that <unk> the kind of material in the tree with fruit, and we found it.
The second <unk> more abundant on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons of people are produced by organisms like shrimp, crab, <unk> and <unk>
We think that if we can tune their properties, we could generate structures that could make a single piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it a legal <unk>  We asked a lot of husks of <unk> <unk> and produced <unk>
<unk> chemical concentrations have been able to achieve a broad range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> and <unk> and soft, and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures -- we built a system with multiple fog <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of material on the march and create these structures made from a single 3.5 material -- 100 percent recyclable stuff.
When the pieces are ready, it leaves them dry in order to find a natural form of contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process was used to contain <unk> <unk> that first appeared on the planet 3.5 billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Along with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> the genetically engineered bacteria to capture a carbon of the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition without problems to mesh issues, and if it extends even more, windows.
A <unk> tree.
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure of shrimp husks in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best part: for objects designed to <unk> jobs in the sea, <unk> life and put them on the soil, they'll grow a tree.
The fit for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We are looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep life for <unk>
To do that, we have to master bacteria and control their flow.
So as the <unk> table, we did our own table of <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> made <unk>
I like to think of the synthetic biology like liquid <unk> only that instead of <unk> metals were <unk> new biological functions inside very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
We put our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> crops <unk>
In our first piece of clothes, we would get two microorganisms.
The first is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and in the tanks of fresh water.
And second, E. <unk> the bacteria that lives in the human intestine.
It turns the light into sugar, the other carbon <unk> and it produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but design.
To contain these relationships, we have created a single channel that looks at the nuptial tract. which will help us <unk> these bacteria and to get it to make their function of way.
So we started making those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of material according to the functionality itself.
If we wanted more <unk> they make more transparent channels.
This immune system, when it goes from one end to another, it's 60 feet.
This is half the length of a football field, and 10 times more than our <unk>
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels with life inside the clothing.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are <unk> <unk> only half is <unk>
What if design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase as well.
And if we could make personal <unk> that we prescribe our skin, we put the fabric off, and we prescribe our <unk>
Think of this as a form of edit biology.
I call this the material ecology.
So for that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now, you know that a 3D printer made material in layers.
It also knows that nature doesn't do that.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of the <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture of a home within which it was <unk>
<unk> manufacturing is about this level of <unk>
It does it through the combination of two materials, but two different proteins in different <unk>
One acts as structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, which are <unk> those fibers in each other.
And this is happening across scales.
The silk worm first turns into the environment, it creates a tension, and then it starts <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and <unk> the two forces in life, they manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand how this complex process works, we attach a little magnet to the head of a silk worm.
We put it inside a box with infrared sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of the silk worm.
However, when I put the silk worm into a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that it was <unk> a cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started to design different settings -- different <unk> and we found that the shape -- the composition, the <unk> structure being transmitted directly by the environment.
They often <unk> the silk worms to death within their <unk> their silk <unk> and they used in the <unk> industry.
What we saw is designing these templates we can shape the raw silk without a single <unk>
It was <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we came up with this process to the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> doing <unk> and we put it into our site.
We knew the silk tube worms toward the darker areas and <unk> so we use a solar route diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the rays from the light and heat it is the silk worms on the structure.
We were ready to get to the <unk>
We asked the silk worms to a silk farm online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were prepared to get it with us.
We put them carefully on the bottom edge of the <unk> and as they <unk> <unk> they <unk> and put eggs, and life starts again, like us, but much, much more short.
Buckminster Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and it was right.
<unk> biological silk on <unk> <unk> <unk> they give all this pavilion to their integrity.
And in little more than two or three weeks, we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And on a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the <unk>
<unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk is using a robotic arm, the other full ball, the other.
If the last frontier of the design of design is to make the products and the buildings around us, to form an ecology of two materials, designers must bring these two visions of the world.
Which brings us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here is a new era of design, a new era of creation, that brings us from a design inspired by an inspired nature of the design that demands us, for the first time, that we do care of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you ever wondered what you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember what age they had when they asked them for the first time this?
You can <unk> with your fingers.
Three. Five. Five. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I didn't have any interest, but I had <unk>
At the school I liked English, the <unk> and the art and I took websites -- I think, would play the guitar on a punk punk called <unk> <unk>
You may have heard of us.
And in general, I like to test and persist anyway, for having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But with the time this feeling of, this feeling of, this feeling of, it's not a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to move it on.
But then I get struck for something else, something completely different, and I would get myself on it, and I am going to <unk> and I feel <unk> I've found it <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to go on.
But then I would like to discover something new and different, and I would like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn this whole thing into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, denying all of my other passions -- and we would give them to <unk>
The other reason that caused me so much anxiety was a little more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something bad about me for no <unk>
I was worried about being afraid of engagement, or to be <unk> or <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to have raised then.
They would get themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where the <unk> learned it from culture.
And we asked the first question, "What do you want to be <unk>
We have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares what it was at that age.
It's considered a naive question to make cute answers in kids like <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or want to be <unk>
It was the <unk> <unk> here.
So this question is going to take us over and over again as we grow in various ways, <unk> <unk> students are asking them to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It's going to be the cute <unk> exercise before what the dream.
Why?
If this question is inspired by children to dream about what might be, is not to dream with everything they might be.
In fact, it does the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't answer with 20 different things, even though adult adults are likely to be <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be a <unk> <unk> <unk>
You have to be <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor turned into <unk> <unk> a teacher and creative principal.
But most kids don't hear people like this.
All you hear is that they're going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of the fate or the real <unk> the idea that every one of us has something to be involved during this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and dedicate your life to that.
But if you're somebody who is not connected in this way?
What if there are a lot of different issues that wake up their curiosity and many different things that wants to do?
There's no place for someone like one in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that you don't have a goal.
And feeling there is something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is somebody with a lot of interests and creative activities.
It's a <unk>
It could help you get into three parts: multiple potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms that you can use the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the age of the Renaissance, the ideal was the one who was okay in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
<unk> any term you like or <unk> your own.
It seems like a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see the <unk> like limitation or <unk> you should win.
But what I've learned talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in the way that way.
Here's three superpowers <unk>
One: synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and creating something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests in create data visualization, visualization, and design and design.
<unk> is a company that creates jewelry <unk> <unk>
<unk> and Rachel came came up with this unique idea by his <unk> mix of skills and experiences.
Innovation happens at intersections.
This is from the new ideas.
And the <unk> with all their own, they can get a lot of these <unk>
The second superpower <unk> is learning fast.
When we <unk> it was interested in something, we go to it.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to being <unk> because it was a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid to test new things and go out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we've learned to every new area that <unk> so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> full time and an independent artist.
As a child pianist <unk> an incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before it became a writer, it was a financial <unk>
He had to learn the highest retail mechanics when they started their practices, and this ability to write a compelling launches for the editors.
It's rarely a loss of time to go to what you're going to tell you even if at the end of it.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower <unk> is adaptability. It is, the ability to transition into anything that you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes the director of videos -- another network designer, sometimes a bow of Kickstarter, and sometimes teacher, James <unk>
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He is even more valuable because it can take diverse <unk> depending on the needs of their clients.
<unk> magazine, Company defines as the most important skill for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be able to bring the needs of the market -- the ones that really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, quickly learning and <unk> three skills where the <unk> are very <unk> and three skills you could lose if you're <unk> to reduce your goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging <unk> to themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in their heart.
They would know that they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you.
In fact, some of the best teams of the best teams of a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive deeper and put in practice, ideas, and <unk> offers an amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that are going to deal with the way we are connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> largely <unk> they are just more like their fellow <unk>
Once you said this, if there's one thing that you will take from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with the internal <unk> whatever it is.
If you are a heart attack, then you go through all the media.
That's where you will give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who have just noticed to be one of them in the last 12 minutes,   I say, <unk> with your many passions.
Keep his curiosity through those <unk> of <unk>
<unk> the intersections.
<unk> our internal wiring brings us to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most important, <unk> the world will give us.
Thank you.
In the year <unk> a woman named <unk> led to a psychiatric psychiatric disease.
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of their life.
His doctor called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but let them until that, unfortunately, he passed away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> he did a <unk> and they found strange plates and <unk> in the <unk> brain of a guy that had never seen before.
The even more amazing thing.
If you would have been living today, we couldn't give it more help than <unk> gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to receive a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's.
Since <unk> medicine has advanced a lot.
They have discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from the <unk> many treatments for cancer, antiretroviral drugs for the <unk> and so much more.
But it's been made on Alzheimer's.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million worldwide.
But by 2050, it'll affect 150 million which, by the way, including a lot of you.
If you expect to live up to 85 years or more, the ability to get Alzheimer's will be almost one in two.
In other words, there is the likelihood that it will be given their <unk> disease or helping to take care of a friend or to be loving with Alzheimer's.
In America, Alzheimer's disease costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of healthcare is spent on disease disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and its costs -- an increase in five times in the year 2050, as the generation of <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's disease is one of the greatest medical challenges of our generation.
But it's been relatively little to <unk>
Today, one of the first 10 causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that cannot be able to cure or even slow their development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's disease than other diseases because we spend less time and money in the research.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer cancer than Alzheimer's disease despite the fact that we have more Alzheimer's and cause number a similar number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what time people are, but everyone else <unk> Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last few years, all of the last few years, all of the scientists, <unk> Alzheimer's with aging.
We thought it will be <unk> in a normal part and inevitable part of aging.
But there's only one of you looking at a picture of a young aged brain compared to the <unk> patient.
In addition to unleash a severe loss of memory and mental skills, the brain caused by 80 percent. significantly life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and <unk> strangers in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know much about this.
We now know that they're made of molecules of protein.
You can think a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds as an origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds up, these <unk> points, end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some <unk> dots are left on the outside.
This makes these protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form large plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University, trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are lots of steps, and the <unk> of what step block is complex, as a bomb.
I would have a cable to do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb bomb.
You have to find the right step that we can do, and then create a drug that it does.
Until recently, in its most of you have reduced the wires and waited for the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, and physical <unk> physical organizations, engineers, and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. Now it's testing a new kind of drugs that stretch specifically this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our latest results.
No one outside our lab has seen yet.
Let's see some videos of what happened to the test of these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see that they move normally.
These maggots, on the other hand, have molecules of protein that stick into each other, like in humans with Alzheimer's.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But when we give our new drugs to these worms in an early stage, then we see that we see it <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just an initial initial outcome but the research like this shows that Alzheimer's disease is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of wait, there's real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to grow that hope, to defeat Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to argue that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we <unk> it can be <unk>
In the case of other diseases, the patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure on governments, drug industry and <unk>
That was essential to move HIV in the late 1980s.
We see that same unit to overcome cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk about themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones day and night are often too <unk> to go out and advocate for the change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs the peril.
Today, there's 40 million patients like <unk> who cannot create the change they need for themselves.
They were talking about them, and helping to demand a cure.
Thank you.
So we had this article in the visual column -- in the New York Times in January of this year.
To love someone, to do this.
The article is about a psychological study, designed to create romantic love in the lab, and in my own experience to try it back one night in the summer of the summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: Two strangers are <unk> to get more and more personal questions and then both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions of example.
Number one: If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or skill, what would that be?
Number four: When was the last time you would give someone another person?
And <unk>
In <unk> they are increasingly personal.
Number three: <unk> really struck me by your partner what you like about it or it, I know it was very honest this time, and I gave the things that you didn't say to someone you've ever met.
When I came across this study a few years ago, a detail really struck me, the gadget of two of the participants had married six months later, and invited all of the lab to the <unk>
So it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, it was also <unk>
And when I was able to test this study, with someone who knew not particularly well, I didn't expect to <unk>
However, we had a lot of us, and I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the column like this: would they have a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I suppose some of you probably ask yourselves -- they are going to follow together yet.
And the reason I think I challenge this is because I've done this question again and again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
A week before he was published the article was very nervous.
I had been working on a book in the last few years, so I had moved me to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog entrance can get to some hundreds of seen as a lot, and those were usually just my friends on Facebook and imagined that my article in the New York Times would probably have a few thousands of view.
And that came across a relatively new burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But it didn't have any idea.
The article was published on a Friday night, and on Saturday, this happened on my blog.
And the Sunday, I've already called the campus, Show and "Good <unk> <unk>
Within a month, the article received more than eight million views, and I was, by saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster the confidence by writing with hope about their own <unk> experiences, but another thing is to discover that the loving life of a has been international news --  and that people all over the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called it or <unk> what they did every day for weeks, they always did the same question: still follow together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I did a quick search on the mailbox of my email with the phrase, <unk> keep <unk>
And several messages came up immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strangers and <unk> like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
They even gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately got red.
I understand that this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international newspaper, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions appeared to be <unk> their own.
In fact, the New York Times published an article by San <unk> that included the experiences of readers to test the study in them with different degrees of success.
So my first urge to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that we both did a public emergence together.
<unk> television interviews, and <unk> the orders of us two.
I think I was afraid to become a fear of <unk> the <unk> process -- a range of which I didn't feel at all.
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked, they wanted to know if they really <unk> or so if it was able to produce love -- not just an adventure, but real love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to respond.
My relationship was just a few months, and I felt about everything, that people made the wrong question.
How do you know if you were <unk> or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was no, I would make the experience of doing these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of the researcher was not to produce romantic love.
Instead of looking at how I was looking for interpersonal students in college students, using what they had, called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Sounds like romantic, right?
But the study did work.
The participants were found closer after doing -- several later studies, they also used <unk> protocol <unk> as a rapid way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They've used it between the police members and the community, and they've used it among people in the opposite political <unk>
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer summer, which combines personal questions with four minutes of eye contact, was cited in this article, but unfortunately published.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a little liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and told me with <unk> <unk> the studio and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, you want to say that you love the person with you who <unk>
Well, he made a pause for it.
I think she just wants to be friends.
And I said, but they got better friends?
<unk> that they managed to get better better after proving the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
But I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I came across the study for the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really difficult separation of it.
I had had that relationship since I had 20, what I was supposed to almost all of my adulthood, and he was my first true love and I had no idea how or I could live without him.
So I brought to science.
And I did everything I could find on the science of romantic love, and I expected that that could be sort of <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the moment I thought I only did for the book I was writing but in retrospect, it really seems to be <unk>
I thought that if I met the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and I used to sit then.
And all this knowledge has been useful in one way or another.
I'm more patient. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence in demand than I am.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than you reasonably need to demand me.
What I'm looking for for the love is a dancer, not just to be <unk> today and being <unk> tomorrow, but I'm going to keep being <unk> by the person I love.
It may be the guarantee that people would ask when they wanted to know whether we were still together.
The story that the media told about the 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way to somehow mitigate some of the risk of risk, and this is a very controversial story, because in love it makes us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story of the story that says, still follow together?
And their content with a response to Yes or No.
So more than a question, let's tell you more difficult questions, questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who doesn't?
How do I stay in love with when things go down, and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship? Or even more, how do you live with the doubt of your <unk>
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more unequal conversation about what it means to love somebody.
So if you want the short version of my relationship, it's <unk> it does a year ago, a known and we applied a study designed to create romantic love, and we are still following together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love is not the same thing that will remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article <unk> the love didn't happen.
<unk> fell in love because we took the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit about reading it now, not because it's not true, but because at the time, there was no thought that that choice was supposed to be done.
I didn't think how many times would we have to take that decision, and how much times I will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he would always be able to choose or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and responded for 36 questions, and have chosen to love someone so generous, kind and fun and have expressed that choice on the largest daily newspaper.
But what I've done, instead, is to turn my relationship to the kind of myth that I don't really do.
And what I think about and what might happen my life for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy ending implicit in the title of my article, which is, by the way, the only part of the article I didn't write about.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to love someone, and the hope that he also love, and it's frightening, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised in full <unk> and in some way I came like a forest <unk>
The city of New York is a time.  One thing that really affected me but more detail later.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a wooden box and <unk> a dollar bill and a <unk> and a fork in Colorado.
And I thought some of them, and I thought some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species, ideas, for example, how do we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has fun because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes.
At a moment when I was in <unk> <unk> like to go from ride and <unk> and all those things <unk> and I was doing a collage of my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I took a kind of <unk> <unk> to the style Agnes Martin, the wrapped of resin and a bee was <unk>
Well, my mother has a fear of bees and it's <unk> to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking that I could <unk>
Instead, it happened the opposite of it, somehow it seemed like it grew up the text with a <unk>
So I did I built more boxes.
This time, I started to add electronic elements, we were strange and strange bottles that I was finding on the streets, everything that I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God can draw in space.
I can flow out by drawing it just like a body on the crime scene.
And I took the objects and I created my own taxonomy of individuals who were <unk>
First of all, <unk> that you'll be able to do an idea.
Then I made some insects and creatures.
It was very fun to draw on the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibits and those things, and I was making some money from money, to bring my girlfriend for dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great man.
At some point I got interested in the human form of the human form, the very natural size of natural size, with drawings of human beings inside the layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was hooked.
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I went to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass layers, similar to the drawing of a window then in a window and another window, and it had all these windows together, that forming a three-dimensional composition of it.
And this really worked. And so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work was going on with something very big, I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by a big measure of <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of the <unk> in Spain.
You know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of their time.
Well, <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs <unk> pounds.
5.5 feet long.
It has double a face, so it's 10 meters away.
It's kind of weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all of these creatures with animals travel between two worlds.
You're going out of the world of representation, this <unk> <unk> <unk>
Here is where the creatures with animals are headed by <unk> lists to suicide mass <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a god bird tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform, the <unk> <unk> shelter of Osama bin Laden, there are all kinds of weird things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
Anyway, also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while the other hand goes out of the clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it seems like a <unk> that holds the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's a <unk> thing.
It's a little bit of a narrative.
That is the hand that we <unk>
And then, when you go to the other side, it has a <unk> like a bird peak and spits it out of this <unk>
It also has a <unk> <unk> <unk> a snake <unk> that joins the <unk>
Anyway, his tail turn on fire on the <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why that happened.
Things that go up, you know.
Her tail ends up on an eye eyeball made out of paint terrorist cards.
Have you <unk>
They did in the 1980s, as if they were dancing cards of terrorists.
Very <unk> for your time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six years ago to make 100 of these human beings.
Each is an archive of our culture, through media and material to be <unk> dictionaries or magazines.
But each one acts as a kind of an archive in the form of being human, and travel in groups of 20, four or 12 or 12 at the time.
They're like cells, they come together, they get together.
And you can walk between them.
Each one is basically a <unk> microscope that weighs 1.3 pounds of a human being caught inside.
This has a little cave on the chest.
That's the <unk> it's the chest, it can be <unk>
I'm going to see you the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and it covers the penis or <unk> or whatever it has to do, a kind of thing you do.
It's a quick advance of these works because I can't get it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a body in half.
This has two heads -- and it's communicating between the two.
There's a little bit of pills coming out and come into the head of this strange statue there.
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
Can you imagine?
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box called <unk> <unk>
And within this box there is a physical, a neuroscientist, a painter, a musician, a musician, a <unk> a school, a publishing arm that spreads all the content we do in the world -- and a garden.
We put the box and all the people inside it hits each other like particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you get older, who is and the box that it's living on.
And together we got to realize that we all are together in this, which is this illusion that we are different, these concepts of the countries, of the boundaries, of religion, does not work.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start to swap those things with sweet and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when you hurt your head?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill has effect against pain, first of the stomach, the guts and other organs.
It will take a pill is the most effective and <unk> system, so that any drug will effect on the body.
<unk> though, is that they <unk> any drug <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in patients with HIV.
When they take drugs that are <unk> they have to decrease the amount of viruses in the blood, and increase the death of <unk> cells.
But they are also known for their side effects, <unk> in their <unk> most negative, because in the time they take it to the current stream -- they will be <unk> and worse than the time they take it to their destination, which is where it's most important, in the warehouse of HIV.
These are regions of the body as the lymph percent, the nervous system, the nervous system, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't go easily in the blood stream of patients who are attached to regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the disruption of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the big issue of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a long-term treatment of life run by <unk>
One day, I sat down and thought, "Hey, do the treatment directly into the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk> of the <unk>
As a scientific expert in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for care of wounds and heart surgery, you can use it for anything <unk> including the transportation transport of drugs.
In fact, we are already using laser pulses to open up or drill extremely small holes, that open and shut down almost immediately the cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best people are asked, "What is that happening?
We sent a little bit of a laser beam of laser laser on the cellular membrane while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of microseconds.
Before they even notice, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or on <unk> plates, but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
How is that <unk> you can <unk>
Well, the answer is, through a three heads.
With the first head, which is our laser, we will do a <unk> in the site of the infection.
The second head, which is a camera, it's moving to the infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug, the drug releases it directly into the site of infection, as the laser is used again to keep the stem cells.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if it has successful, this technology can lead to total HIV from the body.
Yeah. It's a cure for HIV.
This is the dream of the whole researcher of <unk> in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying armed groups <unk> domestic organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
You know, what these groups do when they're not shoot 'n.
My goal is to better understand these <unk> agents of violence and study ways to encourage violent participation to violent participation to the <unk>
I do business work, in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding these groups are key to solving almost every conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
It's now a conflict between the states and non-state actors.
For example, of the <unk> peace agreements between 1975 and 2011, <unk> signed up between a state and an actor not government <unk>
So we have to understand these <unk> even we have to be able to <unk> or <unk> in any successful leadership process.
But how do we do that?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well for the reasons why they do it, but nobody looks at what they do when they don't exist.
The armed struggle and political politics are <unk>
Everything is part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
<unk> groups today are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for their violent <unk> against Israel.
From their creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political game, a network of social services and a military device.
Similarly, the Palestinian Palestinian known by their suicide attacks, against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza since 2007.
So these groups do more than just to fire.
It's multitasking multitasking
We had a complex communication machinery stations, television, websites and websites and strategies on social networks.
And here you have the <unk> printed magazine in English and published to <unk>
The armed groups also invest in a complex fundraising <unk> but by <unk> business -- for example, building companies built.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to recruit better and build their brand.
The armed groups do something else: they create stronger bonds with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, run hospitals, put their professional training programs, or <unk> programs.
<unk> offers all these services and more.
The armed groups are also trying to conquer the population by providing something that is not making security and protection.
The ascent of Taliban in an Afghanistan ripped through the war, or even the beginning of the rise of <unk> can also be able to look at the efforts of these groups for giving security security.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a higher death price for the population.
But in general, providing social services means filling a <unk> a <unk> gap by government, and lets these groups strengthen and increase their power.
For example, victory victory in 2006 of Palestinian Hamas cannot be understood without acknowledging the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario -- even in the West, when we look at the <unk> groups, we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the vision for the long term.
These groups are <unk>
And so they would have to do that because they have a lot of <unk> gaps by the government, and they emerge as the armed and political and political groups, participate in nonviolent struggle and bring governance.
And the more complex and the more complex organizations are these organizations, we can see it as something opposite to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
And so it turns out a part of a territory, they run all their <unk> they collect the trash system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, of nations and <unk> and the more weak it is the states, like in the Middle East, more <unk> and fill that gap the non-state actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in the tools not military tools.
<unk> that government vacuum has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put it into peace.
If we understand better groups -- we will understand better what incentives to foster violence is not violence.
In this new dispute between states and non-state actors -- military power can make a few battles, but we don't give us peace and stability.
To achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill that safe vacuum of security, to fill out that government empty that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and as a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to accept the tag on <unk> it would be unfair for the <unk>
I'm a <unk> but quite bad.
And therefore I got confused as a bad feminist.
Or at least I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> <unk> and then in interviews, people started calling me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself and a <unk> <unk> has become something bigger.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and 20 years, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women were born with the men and that they would make sex as if that was bad.
Today, I see how women are treated all over the world and anger, in particular, it looks like a perfectly reasonable response.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to <unk> that could be a feminist.
Being labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a very taboo and unpleasant word.
I love myself as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, who calls too much, with high self-worth and <unk> to believe it's equal to a man.
No one wants to be that woman <unk> until it realizes that it actually is that woman and you can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I was growing up, as I was growing up, I started accepting that I am, in fact, <unk> and also proud of it.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
They would take the same wages for the same work.
We have the right to travel around the world as the <unk> <unk> or violence.
We have right to use very easy and accessible the contraceptives and <unk> services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, without needing checks or doctrines to <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have to figure out our other <unk>
We are not only women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and <unk> and so much more.
We need to have to have these differences and how we care about what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our Feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear, I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I drive to the work, I hear rap music -- <unk> to all volume.
Although the letter degrades the women and so offends me, the classic <unk> <unk> of the yin -- yang <unk> is amazing.
You actually have your <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get rid of the <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely <unk> by my musical music.
I firmly believe in the work of the man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> -- all of the tasks -- but also killing insects, the collection of junk and <unk> <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The rose is my favorite color.
It was <unk> from the fashion magazines and the nice things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of the fairy tales that make place.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of his husband, he is his choice, and I am not who for <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise his children, I know that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that it makes women economically vulnerable to their society as well.
So let's take this problem.
The conventional Feminism has been ignored or <unk> historically the needs of the color, the male workers, the gay workers, and <unk> for white women, <unk> and high and high class.
Listen, if that's good Feminism I'm a very bad feminist indeed.
It also happens as this: <unk> <unk>
We have this tendency to put <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We expect it to be perfection.
When we get rid of the <unk> with a lot of <unk> from the same <unk> where they <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I consider that <unk> before you try to put up there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative and leaders are afraid to be tagged as a <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I am <unk> fear of what that tag means for fear of not being able to fulfill the little realistic expectations.
Take an example of <unk> or like I call it, the <unk>
In the last few years, it's a feminist feminist <unk>
In <unk> Music 2014, in 2014, <unk> in front of the word <unk> of three meters tall.
It was a <unk> show, watching this star of poop embrace the Feminism and to get women to young men who be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, cultural critics started endless <unk> if <unk> was or not a feminist.
He <unk> his feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection because we're still struggling for a lot, we want a lot, we need a lot of <unk>
We go much beyond the sane criticism of sensible criticism and <unk> to <unk> the feminism of any woman, <unk> until there is nothing.
We don't need to do that.
The bad self or rather, a more inclusive Feminism is the point of <unk>
So what happens next?
We went to recognize our <unk> to give it to the action and be a little more <unk>
If I listen to music, I am creating a demand for artists who would be more happy by providing a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they <unk> their profits.
It's certainly hard.
Why does it have your music to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when the bad choices make this make it harder for women to achieve equality, gender equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think about three and four years old.
It's two girls and <unk> and bright, and also very <unk> I want you to grow up in a world.
It is where you get rid of the strong creatures that are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best option is going to be <unk> as much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program tries to sexual violence against women as sport, <unk> the <unk>
We can change the radio stations when we hear songs that treat women like anything.
We can spend our money to go to the cinema in another part when movies don't deal with women more than like objects.
We can stop supporting sports sports where athletes treat their classmates like <unk>
In any case, the men, especially privileged men can say, "No, I'm not going to post it on his magazine, participate in their project, or work with you, until it doesn't include a number of enough women, both to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but <unk> to participate in this kind of projects, we can also empower them to be included until more as people are empowered to overcome the barriers to the decision making.
Because we are not <unk> <unk> Without these efforts, without embracing these <unk> our achievements are going to mean very little.
We can make these small acts of courage and hope that our decisions will come to the top, people in the power of directors and film producers and music, <unk> <unk> people who can make great decisions decisions to create a durable and significant change.
We can also claim with the courage of our feminism, good, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book <unk> <unk> says, <unk> be a bad feminist to be <unk>
This is true because of many reasons, but I tell you, most of all, because I got my voice on my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it incident to address what happened.
A couple of kids would tell me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
I was treated like anything.
I started believing it was nothing.
<unk> my voice, and after everything I didn't bother to believe I could say something that could matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I was struck by a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and understood what meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of women who showed me that was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and I also found that if I was a little brave, another woman could hear me and see me and realize that none of us is the nothing that the world is trying to tell us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I have the <unk> reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad feminist -- I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope we can all be a little courageous, when you need such a <unk>
Just after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California had been <unk> because they had to be exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things of this outbreak is that <unk> which may be lousy for a child with an immune system is one of the most easily unexplored diseases.
There's an effective vaccine against this for over half a century -- but a lot of the kids involved in the <unk> outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposed to be still <unk>
But a moment -- it was not the article that unleashed controversial about autism, and vaccines are <unk> and marked by being an accounting fraud by the British Medical School.
It doesn't believe most intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world are still <unk> that vaccines will put their children into their children to have autism.
Why?
So here's why.
This is a graph of the increasing estimates of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very rare disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about it create their entire professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the prevalence estimates continued only three or four children per 10 <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started <unk>
<unk> courses like <unk> <unk> are routinely routinely routinely the autism as an epidemic as if I could get it from another child in <unk>
What's going on here?
If it's not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people from the Center for Disease Disease Control what is going on, they tend to tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnostic diagnostic and "a better <unk> detection to explain these <unk> numbers.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother who seeks in their face of two years, the visual contact.
If the breast criteria had to be done, why they were so reduced at the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened that happened is less than to do with slow progress and <unk> of science that with the <unk> power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what autism is and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same is having a devastating impact on global health.
There was a second most accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us everything about how we get here and where we need to go.
The first story starts with a child psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital <unk> in <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients who looked like <unk> worlds and <unk> people around them, even their own parents.
They could fun for hours waving their hands before their faces, but they were prey to panic because he didn't put his favorite toy in his usual place without knowing them.
Over the base of the patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the 1950s, as the main authority of the world on the subject, stated that I had seen less than 150 true cases of his syndrome as it was <unk> from places as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria of <unk> for autism diagnosis was very <unk>
For example, <unk> will give children to children with seizures but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once he turned out that he had turned to 9 percent of 10 kids to his office to be autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart, but part of his theories weren't <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of <unk> child caused by cold parents.
And these kids, he said, they have kept in a refrigerator they didn't understand.
At the same time, though, <unk> noticed that some of their young patients had special skills that they put in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before he turned two years old.
When his mother put one of his favorite records, he says, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, affirming things like the kids were just <unk> what they heard about their parents' parents for winning their approval.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to the institutions for their own good, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the decade of 1970, the researchers started to test the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> <unk> an cognitive psychologist in London, I thought the theory of mothers came out of <unk> was pretty stupid.
She and his husband came up and warm and <unk> and they had a profound autistic child called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how difficult it was to raise a child like <unk> without special education, no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To stand before the National Health Service, that they needed more resources for autistic children, and their families, and his colleague, Judith Gould decided to do something that should have done 30 years before.
They ran a study of autism prevalence in the general population.
It was a suburb of London called <unk> to try and find kids autistic in the community.
What you saw is that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse than autism was much more <unk>
Some kids couldn't speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination with astrophysics, in the dinosaurs or the <unk> of <unk>
In the other way, these kids didn't fit into nice frames and <unk> as he said, and they saw a lot more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
Initially, they were lost by trying to make sense of their data.
How did nobody realize these kids before?
But then <unk> I found a reference to an article that was published in a German year in <unk> the year after the <unk> article, and then he got caught buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article of competition, but I stopped cutting it into his own work.
I hadn't even an English translation of English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> spoke German, and he was doing it for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran an integrated clinic with a school for a school for the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in their clinic started with music exercises with music, and the kids kept their games on Sunday afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, described described as disability <unk> of life that required <unk> and <unk> spaces for the course of all life.
Instead of treating children in their clinic as patients and calls them their little teachers, and he got to help in the development of education that were particularly suited for them.
And basically, autism has seen autism as a diverse continuum that included an amazing variety of gifts, and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were <unk> and they always been, seeing aspects of this continuum in <unk> known culture as the awkward social scientist and Professor <unk>
He went beyond even to say, that for success in science and art, a little bit of autism is critical.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was very wrong that autism was <unk> as well as parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked on silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of the diagnostic Association that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the end of the 1980s and early '90s, their changes came into <unk> <unk> the limited model of <unk> for a broad and <unk>
These changes were not in a <unk>
<unk> when I came back, and Judith worked backstage to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before it came out <unk> <unk> I know what autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> I knew what autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> with four <unk> of the <unk> <unk> psychologists and parent from everyone else knew what the autism.
At the same time, they were introduced to the first easy clinics to use autism.
I didn't have to have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm of the consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnoses started <unk> just like they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact they were expected to be able to get the people with autism and their families finally support the support and services that were <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines for the increase in <unk> a simple, powerful, and <unk> history as bad as the theory of <unk> that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the preventing prevention center that one of every 68 children in the United States are in the spectrum, is right, the autistic are one of the largest <unk> groups in the world.
In the last few years, people are being joined on the Internet to reject the idea that are the puzzles for solving by the new medical advances -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the strains of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think in terms of living operating systems.
The fact that a PC does not work with the Windows doesn't mean it's cut.
According to the <unk> <unk> the normal human brain is easily <unk> social aid, and it's a deficit deficit on the details.
Indeed, people are autistic people, they have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still getting <unk> which creates the <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism is found in understanding of teachers, employers with capacity, communities with ability, and parents with faith in their children.
An autistic woman called <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the ship of the <unk>
As we went into an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We cannot afford to afford a brain.
Thank you.
